00:00:00.120 the trough in that liquidity cycle was
00:00:02.639 October of
00:00:04.080 2022 and the next Peak is slated to be
00:00:07.000 sometime late in 2025 and as I said I
00:00:09.960 think there are three major demands on
00:00:11.719 markets for liquidity over the next uh
00:00:14.639 year or so one
00:00:16.320 is like a lot of people are insanely
00:00:19.119 bullish right now that's at least like
00:00:20.880 my anecdotal evidence that I have and
00:00:22.920 this then again is usually I would argue
00:00:25.119 also some sign of caution we're not risk
00:00:27.359 off yet but we're basically if money is
00:00:30.880 being used to roll over debt it's not
00:00:32.880 being used to buy you know technology
00:00:34.960 stocks or Bitcoin or whatever else that
00:00:37.280 may be the
00:00:38.320 problem meet Michael Howell the CEO and
00:00:41.719 founder of crossb capital a leading
00:00:44.440 independent research and investment firm
00:00:46.480 based in London with over 40 years of
00:00:49.440 experience in financial markets Michael
00:00:52.160 is an expert in liquidity Trends and
00:00:54.879 capital flows helping institutional
00:00:57.559 investors navigate the global finan
00:01:00.440 landscape before founding crossb Capital
00:01:03.840 he held key positions at Salamon
00:01:06.040 brothers and bearing Securities what we
00:01:09.040 got to recognize here that many things
00:01:11.479 in a world of debt refinancing are Topsy
00:01:13.799 Turvy they're upside down it's like
00:01:15.360 living in an Al in one the L world
00:01:17.119 compared to what you're Houston but
00:01:18.880 that's the reality we've got to accept
00:01:20.600 that so liquidity and debt uh have this
00:01:24.000 uh partnership where they both rise
00:01:25.840 together and therefore uh what we're
00:01:28.240 seeing with a rising death environment
00:01:30.520 uh is a rising liquidity environment if
00:01:32.799 you want to invest over the next 25
00:01:34.600 years and you expect government debt to
00:01:36.759 increase significantly and I would argue
00:01:38.840 that's inevitable because of Aging
00:01:40.759 demographics then you've got to expect
00:01:43.159 debt to rise liquidity to rise and the
00:01:45.920 price of gold and Bitcoin to rise over
00:01:47.840 the medium
00:01:48.680 [Music]
00:01:51.119 term hey hey guys so I'm back with
00:01:54.040 another episode this time I have uh
00:01:56.719 somebody somebody from the UK if I'm not
00:01:59.240 mistaken H it's uh Michael how better
00:02:02.399 known as crossb capital on X I've been
00:02:05.880 following him for quite some time it's
00:02:08.520 been very interesting to listen to other
00:02:10.598 interviews that you have given just such
00:02:12.959 a unique perspective obviously with all
00:02:15.560 the background that you bring and it's
00:02:17.720 just amazing to have you here today hi
00:02:19.879 Michael hi Pascal very good to be here
00:02:22.599 there's a interesting times many things
00:02:24.760 to talk about yeah exactly yeah it's
00:02:27.440 that kind of cool for the first time I
00:02:28.959 can actually do an to you a little
00:02:30.920 little earlier because I think you and
00:02:32.720 me were both in Europe so quite close in
00:02:35.120 terms of timing usually I do these
00:02:36.879 episodes with people from the states and
00:02:38.599 then yeah it's it's me like doing this
00:02:41.800 at night but now this time really nice
00:02:44.680 yeah that we Are CL closely connected so
00:02:47.000 to say also geographically so um yeah
00:02:50.400 maybe if you could just quickly give an
00:02:53.200 introduction to yourself you know where
00:02:55.440 you're coming from and then also yeah
00:02:57.720 what your main topics are this would be
00:02:59.440 great
00:03:00.959 yeah sure um crossb capital is an
00:03:03.200 advisory company uh it's been going for
00:03:05.760 about 25 years um prior to that I was in
00:03:09.280 in Investment Banking I started off at
00:03:11.200 Salomon Brothers the US Investment Bank
00:03:14.560 Salomon Brothers for people that don't
00:03:16.040 know pretty much was the fixed income
00:03:17.920 markets uh in the 80s and early 90s uh
00:03:21.040 it was the dominant Force worldwide uh
00:03:23.360 salmer Brothers probably uh has got the
00:03:26.000 reputation of having more more Nobel
00:03:28.040 Prize winners than exclus myself I was
00:03:30.519 see from that in the film anybody else
00:03:34.319 um you know people like Marin Schulz
00:03:36.319 robt Merton were were working there uh
00:03:39.760 and it was very research driven uh we
00:03:42.879 needed to understand uh how markets
00:03:45.519 worked uh it was a question of watching
00:03:48.599 money flows trying to put that into a
00:03:50.799 sensible framework and out of that whole
00:03:54.079 uh research effort uh this concept of
00:03:57.040 global liquidity kind of emerged uh in a
00:03:59.799 emerged in the mid 1980s uh it was at a
00:04:02.680 time when financial markets were
00:04:04.599 internationalizing fast uh it was a
00:04:07.239 period where crossb Capital flows were
00:04:09.239 nent but beginning to accelerate and it
00:04:12.519 was something which was a valuable tool
00:04:14.879 when s and brothers was trying to
00:04:16.720 understand its proprietary trading it
00:04:18.320 did vast proprietary trading across the
00:04:20.519 world but it needed to understand those
00:04:22.079 money flows and that's pretty much how
00:04:24.479 the research effort started and ever
00:04:27.160 since that time uh we've been
00:04:29.039 researching in detail uh the direction
00:04:31.560 of uh how money moves in the world
00:04:33.800 economy yes exactly yeah yeah thanks for
00:04:37.000 your for your background and certainly
00:04:39.400 helpful I mean that's exactly what I
00:04:41.039 would like to talk to you about today
00:04:43.720 because as you said you know liquidity
00:04:45.440 it's been uh so so on everybody's mind
00:04:48.960 and also it's been quite like essential
00:04:51.360 in terms of uh what's driving markets
00:04:53.360 and and you probably as one of the few
00:04:55.880 has has certainly uh Been instrumental
00:04:58.120 in bringing this topic to to people's
00:05:00.199 attention as a flate or or as you say
00:05:02.759 even even since a few years but I feel
00:05:05.400 like more people are waking up to this
00:05:07.440 idea that it's really this essential so
00:05:10.360 um maybe just to kind of set the context
00:05:12.840 you know because what I want to talk to
00:05:14.479 you about today is really like um you
00:05:17.520 know it's Q4 now in 2024 um especially
00:05:21.560 yeah again I was talking to a friend
00:05:23.280 recently he showed me his S&P 500 you
00:05:26.560 know uh investment he was like wow I'm
00:05:29.080 up I don't know 18% since I did this
00:05:32.520 it's crazy you know everything is going
00:05:34.400 wild you have to be invested in the
00:05:36.360 stock market and then obviously if you
00:05:38.479 look at gold and Bitcoin H it's just a
00:05:40.960 similar and probably a greater magnitude
00:05:43.000 in terms of performance but like a lot
00:05:45.080 of people are insanely bullish right now
00:05:47.479 that's at least like my anecdotal
00:05:49.080 evidence that I have no and and this
00:05:51.680 then again is usually I would argue also
00:05:53.880 some sign of caution especially if it's
00:05:55.800 people that are usually not that close
00:05:57.639 to the markets and then are just like
00:05:59.800 this really bullish and showing me these
00:06:01.680 screenshots of of what they have been uh
00:06:04.280 doing lately you know so I think in
00:06:07.000 order to know if this can be extended
00:06:09.880 and where we are going again I think
00:06:11.800 it's really important that we look at
00:06:13.240 what's happening with with global
00:06:14.639 liquidity and in liquidity in general so
00:06:17.039 maybe if you could kind of explain again
00:06:19.520 why liquidity is so in inst instrumental
00:06:22.319 in driving today's financial markets and
00:06:24.479 then also kind of where we are at when
00:06:27.240 in terms of liquidity in terms of the
00:06:28.759 situation and the outlook for for
00:06:31.479 2025 yeah but if we could start with the
00:06:33.560 first question that would be nice sure
00:06:35.800 okay well let let me um first of all
00:06:38.199 describe what we mean by liquidity
00:06:39.880 because liquidity uh means many
00:06:41.919 different things to many different
00:06:43.199 people uh what we try and do is to hone
00:06:45.880 in on a strict definition of liquidity
00:06:48.280 to make it workable so uh the Theses can
00:06:50.919 be proven or unproven but uh you need a
00:06:53.759 concept concrete concept really to
00:06:55.840 understand and to test things by so what
00:06:57.720 we're looking at is money that is flow
00:06:59.599 going through World Financial Market
00:07:01.960 let's be clear about that it's not money
00:07:03.800 that's in the real economy if money goes
00:07:05.800 into the real economy clearly it leaves
00:07:07.680 financial markets that's not a good
00:07:09.240 thing so what we got to try and
00:07:11.039 understand and try and calibrate is the
00:07:12.840 flow of money through world financial
00:07:14.800 markets and that's what we set ourselves
00:07:17.039 the task to do and for the last 25 30
00:07:19.960 years we've been uh creating databases
00:07:22.319 that actually look at each countries
00:07:24.039 money flows through their financial
00:07:25.720 markets and it's that which we aggregate
00:07:28.120 into a global liquidity concept so
00:07:30.599 that's Point number one by the way all
00:07:32.160 this is uh articulated in detail or
00:07:34.520 described in a book that I wrote uh two
00:07:37.039 or 3 years ago called Capital Wars which
00:07:39.319 is published by palra um in that book we
00:07:42.199 detail uh the whole methodology of
00:07:44.280 liquidity uh we give data and we show
00:07:46.639 how it works so that's for reference in
00:07:49.479 terms of why liquidity is important uh
00:07:52.440 it's important if you like uh maybe from
00:07:55.319 an obvious standpoint that people need
00:07:56.960 money before they transact so money
00:07:59.080 let's go through financial markets is
00:08:01.039 basically transacting in financial
00:08:03.360 assets but I want to go a little bit
00:08:05.120 deeper than that and try and explain uh
00:08:07.479 two features of financial markets that
00:08:09.280 are really important to understand the
00:08:11.520 first concept is to throw away the
00:08:13.560 textbook understanding the capital
00:08:15.720 markets are there to raise money for New
00:08:18.479 Capital spending that's a very nice idea
00:08:21.520 uh it was it worked for a long time but
00:08:23.759 it's not really the world that we live
00:08:24.840 in anymore uh there's not a huge amount
00:08:27.159 of capital spending going on um maybe
00:08:29.759 there's sort of you know Souther
00:08:31.400 appearances of a burst of capital
00:08:33.200 spending but the years of strong Capital
00:08:35.279 spending really over in the sort of 50s
00:08:37.719 60s maybe 70s um most Capital spending
00:08:41.479 now is undertaken in the east in China
00:08:44.360 it's not directed through Capital
00:08:45.720 markets is State it's state organized uh
00:08:48.279 interest rates don't really matter in
00:08:49.880 that context it's not a question of
00:08:51.600 raising interest rates and curtailing
00:08:53.640 the business cycle through uh through
00:08:56.080 increasing the cost of of new capex what
00:08:59.200 cap Capital markets are really about now
00:09:01.839 is huge that huge debt refinancing
00:09:04.680 mechanisms uh something like three out
00:09:06.839 of every four transactions that go
00:09:08.800 through financial markets today in the
00:09:10.959 advanced economies are basically debt
00:09:13.040 rollovers or debt refinancing
00:09:14.880 transactions and that's important to
00:09:17.000 understand in a world where you're doing
00:09:19.079 debt refinancing rolling debt it's not
00:09:21.720 interest rates that really matter so
00:09:23.519 much it's the capacity of the system uh
00:09:26.399 to provide liquidity to roll over debt
00:09:28.880 so balance sheet capacity is the crucial
00:09:31.160 thing and that's really what we're
00:09:32.560 talking about when we're talking about
00:09:34.040 liquidity now if you don't get the
00:09:36.760 balance sheet roll you get a default and
00:09:39.279 you get a refinancing crisis every
00:09:41.920 crisis that you can think of going back
00:09:43.680 over the last two or three decades has
00:09:45.680 fundamentally been a debt refinancing
00:09:48.279 crisis so we need to look at the
00:09:50.640 disconnect potential disconnect between
00:09:53.160 debt and liquidity and that's really the
00:09:55.480 main focus that we have now the second
00:09:58.399 point to make is if you look at the
00:10:00.399 Dynamics of those two factors debt is
00:10:03.640 exponential this evidence what's
00:10:06.320 happening with debt GDP ratios across
00:10:08.720 the West they're growing rapidly
00:10:11.399 particularly public debt and what you
00:10:13.839 also got alongside is liquidity which is
00:10:16.440 largely cyclical so the fact is that one
00:10:19.120 concept is exponential one is cyclical
00:10:21.800 the two are rarely likely to meet and
00:10:24.160 when they disconnect you get a financial
00:10:26.320 crisis so that's why it's important to
00:10:28.399 look at both now in uh there's a slide
00:10:31.079 you can put up which actually shows the
00:10:33.720 global liquidity cycle as we measure it
00:10:36.480 this is in index form and it basically
00:10:39.519 illustrates the movement since uh the
00:10:42.120 early 1970s of global liquidity it shows
00:10:45.680 an index that ranges between zero and
00:10:47.880 100 it's got a mean of 50 and that index
00:10:51.800 of liquidity is measuring the momentum
00:10:54.200 of liquidity flow through World
00:10:56.240 Financial Market on top of that chart
00:10:58.959 we've basically uh overlaid a sine wave
00:11:02.519 just to emphasize that we're not
00:11:04.279 cheating here uh that we're forcing a
00:11:06.680 fit uh that S Wave was actually put in
00:11:09.440 place in year 2000 and for the last 25
00:11:12.279 years it's been extrapolated forward so
00:11:14.600 what you see is what you get and it's
00:11:16.399 lining up pretty nicely now the trough
00:11:18.800 in that liquidity cycle was October of
00:11:22.200 2022 and the next Peak is slated to be
00:11:25.200 sometime late in
00:11:26.720 2025 now the issue that we High L when I
00:11:30.120 come back to this whole point about debt
00:11:32.200 growing exponentially and liquidity
00:11:34.279 being cyclical is there is a growing
00:11:36.639 tension next year which is being raised
00:11:39.600 because of something called the maturity
00:11:41.480 wall now the maturity wall is a name
00:11:45.040 which describes the upcoming refinancing
00:11:48.160 burdens of more and more debt that is
00:11:50.399 being thrown back on the market to be
00:11:52.040 rolled over and that is occurring
00:11:54.279 because in the period of the covid
00:11:56.360 emergency interest rates were pushed
00:11:58.600 down to uh almost zero levels and what
00:12:01.880 that meant was a lot of Corporations
00:12:03.760 households and governments too
00:12:05.680 refinanced at low interest rates and
00:12:08.800 that low interest rate debt is coming up
00:12:11.200 for Renewal uh really in the next two to
00:12:13.440 three years it begins about the middle
00:12:15.120 of 2025 and then starts to Peak sometime
00:12:18.040 around 27 2027 or thereabouts so what
00:12:21.760 you can see is a huge demand coming from
00:12:24.760 financial markets for refinancing that
00:12:27.839 will basically uh detract from current
00:12:31.560 asset price gains if money is being used
00:12:34.320 to roll over debt it's not being used to
00:12:36.399 buy um you know technology stocks or
00:12:38.920 Bitcoin or whatever else and that may be
00:12:40.959 the problem yeah exactly that's that's
00:12:43.639 very well said in the end like it's it's
00:12:45.519 always a yeah wherever money goes and
00:12:47.920 they can't do two things at the same
00:12:49.680 time probably but I want to I want to go
00:12:52.040 uh deeper on this later on as well but I
00:12:54.040 would just plan of hone in on this
00:12:56.040 concept of liquidity with one further
00:12:57.800 question you know because like
00:13:00.120 at least among lay men and and even
00:13:02.480 sometimes economists you see people just
00:13:04.279 focusing on global liquidity you know
00:13:06.160 and then you have like Global M2 uh like
00:13:09.040 all the bank liquidity that'ss out there
00:13:11.199 and that's where they kind of infer
00:13:13.320 whether liquidity is ample or it is not
00:13:15.800 you know and I was just wondering I
00:13:17.399 think you are doing it well not
00:13:20.440 differently but you have like other
00:13:22.600 things that you're looking at I think uh
00:13:24.560 you're you're arguing that M2 the global
00:13:27.040 M2 uh liquidity aggregate that like a
00:13:29.920 lot of people are pointing to are are
00:13:31.480 not the entire picture is that is that
00:13:33.240 correct and if so kind of like what else
00:13:35.720 are you looking at to to Really assess
00:13:37.800 this balance sheet capacity that you
00:13:39.839 were referring to yeah absolutely I mean
00:13:43.639 let's let's drill into that data and try
00:13:45.720 and um uh and clarify what we mean um
00:13:49.399 many people spoken or speak about global
00:13:51.360 liquidy and they can mean central bank
00:13:54.160 balance sheets uh I mean that's a very
00:13:56.440 common um definition of global equility
00:13:59.399 a wrong definition but nonetheless let's
00:14:01.680 stick with it for a moment um Central
00:14:04.079 Bank liquidity is of the order of about
00:14:07.800 uh 3540 trillion doar so it's it's a not
00:14:11.120 you know it's not a a small sum it's a
00:14:13.759 sizable amount of liquidity but in the
00:14:16.199 context of the world uh our Global
00:14:18.759 liquidity Aggregates are something like
00:14:21.320 175 180 trillion so uh Central Bank
00:14:25.199 liquidity is really R doesn't really do
00:14:27.680 it it's it's a part of the picture but
00:14:29.720 it's not the whole equation what you
00:14:31.360 need to look at is the difference is
00:14:33.160 what the private sector is supplying and
00:14:35.360 the private sector is doing that really
00:14:37.240 based on collateral so almost all
00:14:40.160 lending particularly lending in
00:14:41.680 financial markets now ever since the
00:14:44.279 global financial crisis is not based on
00:14:46.759 trust it's based on collateral and you
00:14:48.839 need to post collateral and by
00:14:50.560 collateral I'm thinking here uh of
00:14:52.880 government bonds particularly US
00:14:54.759 Treasury bonds also German bonds uh you
00:14:57.519 know Swiss Confederation B bonds
00:14:59.320 probably used as well to an extent uh in
00:15:01.920 this in this picture uh think of an
00:15:04.839 analogy with a home mortgage that's
00:15:06.480 collateral uh you know against your real
00:15:08.680 estate but all lending now is
00:15:10.399 principally collateral based now on that
00:15:13.360 basis what you need to understand is
00:15:15.199 something called a collateral multiplier
00:15:17.279 and that collateral multiplier will
00:15:18.959 actually raise the value of collateral
00:15:21.560 into liquid uh lending or liquid credit
00:15:25.399 and it's that which we're really talking
00:15:27.120 about which fills that Gap now M2
00:15:29.880 doesn't do that because M2 is simply um
00:15:33.639 the retail deposits of High Street Banks
00:15:38.000 now if you believe that banks are the
00:15:39.639 entire uh picture for the Global
00:15:41.839 Financial system will come quietly Banks
00:15:44.519 were clearly very important in one stage
00:15:46.240 and they dominated the system if we go
00:15:48.000 back to the 1950s and maybe 1960s but
00:15:50.959 from the 1960s as you got deregulation
00:15:53.600 in the financial system High Street
00:15:55.600 Banks were eclipsed by investment banks
00:15:57.959 by other forms of financial institutions
00:16:01.000 the repo Market's developed uh you know
00:16:03.440 explosively uh certainly in the last 20
00:16:06.079 years and we need to look up all types
00:16:08.560 of liquidity simply not uh what is
00:16:11.639 vested in high streak Banks uh and that
00:16:14.600 is M2 so we've got to go beyond that our
00:16:17.440 Aggregates are much bigger and uh
00:16:20.000 liquidity extends generally across the
00:16:22.680 financial system not just in uh in
00:16:24.920 commercial Banks or one owned
00:16:27.120 Banks yeah exactly and that's a great
00:16:29.600 point that you're making and that's also
00:16:31.040 I think because uh what you're saying is
00:16:33.399 resonating with so many people because
00:16:35.319 it seems to like a lot of people are
00:16:37.480 looking at central banks they're all
00:16:39.000 looking at at at commercial Banks but
00:16:41.160 that's like uh that's that's that's
00:16:43.120 about it you know and now uh it's
00:16:45.120 becoming ever more obvious that there's
00:16:46.839 like a shadow banking system so to say
00:16:49.120 as well just other players who have been
00:16:50.959 come quite Monumental in providing like
00:16:53.600 as you said collateral and in that sense
00:16:55.639 and also
00:16:57.480 refinancing capab ilities as well as
00:17:00.040 then yeah just liquidity overall so
00:17:01.920 that's very interesting to certainly
00:17:04.079 have uh have in the back of your mind
00:17:06.359 once when you when you navigate
00:17:08.160 financial markets but yeah so if if if I
00:17:12.319 come back to this maturity wall that you
00:17:14.319 now mentioned you know and it sounds
00:17:16.039 like this debt refinancing needs uh
00:17:18.919 these are I would say sort of something
00:17:22.199 a signal that should kind of uh yeah
00:17:24.799 caution ourselves you know because like
00:17:27.079 it sounds like yeah there there is like
00:17:28.919 demand for liquidity as you said for for
00:17:30.919 this refinancing and once this is taken
00:17:32.880 out by this it can't be used elsewhere
00:17:35.640 but I also feel like yeah it's not a one
00:17:38.600 type event clear-cut data where we can
00:17:40.559 say now this maturity wall is here and
00:17:42.640 we're hit and and from there on we're
00:17:45.039 we're screwed you know so it's probably
00:17:46.440 more of a process like that's emerging
00:17:48.559 but can we kind of already point to
00:17:51.200 where this has started or has it already
00:17:53.440 started or or how how do you think about
00:17:55.960 this as also as an investor then well
00:17:59.159 it's it's beginning and I think you're
00:18:00.679 absolutely correct to say that it's a
00:18:02.360 process not a not a single event uh
00:18:05.120 we're moving into a period where the
00:18:07.280 demands uh on the pool of liquidity are
00:18:09.760 growing uh they're growing from a number
00:18:12.039 of different areas one might be
00:18:14.840 conventional Rising inflation uh another
00:18:17.840 could be the greater demands that are
00:18:19.640 coming out of China a third could be the
00:18:21.760 debt maturity World these are all issues
00:18:24.360 there is a slide a little bit uh further
00:18:26.799 in the presentation that I gave that let
00:18:29.320 me just describe now this is a chart
00:18:31.360 which looks at advanced economies debt
00:18:34.080 as a percentage of uh of liquidity what
00:18:37.159 that shows is a line going back uh to
00:18:40.520 1980 it basically shows the ratio
00:18:43.960 fluctuating around a level of about
00:18:47.000 250% so let me just again say what that
00:18:50.480 means that's looking at the ratio of
00:18:52.799 total uh total debt divided by the pool
00:18:56.320 of liquidity and what I've done is I've
00:18:58.799 adjusted that debt figure for uh the
00:19:02.120 maturity profile of the debt so in other
00:19:04.640 words you've got a normalized picture
00:19:06.440 for debt here assuming sort of
00:19:08.080 homogeneous repayments and what it's
00:19:10.440 taking into account is the fact that
00:19:12.200 you've got uh a growing demand coming up
00:19:15.640 on financial markets from this debt now
00:19:18.440 you'll see if you look at that chart
00:19:20.159 closely that the broken line the dotted
00:19:22.559 line that runs across that chart
00:19:24.640 horizontally is drawn about
00:19:27.159 250% that is an equilibrium above that
00:19:30.320 line you start to see refinancing
00:19:32.880 tensions when the debtal equility ratio
00:19:35.480 Rises it becomes more and more difficult
00:19:37.960 to roll over debt and therefore you get
00:19:40.120 the risk of financial crisis it is the
00:19:42.440 debt liquidity ratio that's critical not
00:19:44.440 the debt GDP ratio that many economists
00:19:47.280 quote and so often in economics uh
00:19:50.320 basically people start to uh calibrate
00:19:52.799 or produce statistics that are easy to
00:19:54.720 gather rather than statistics that may
00:19:56.559 be difficult to gather but are more
00:19:57.960 important and this is more important
00:20:00.080 debt to liquidity is far more important
00:20:02.200 than debt to GDP and if you look at that
00:20:05.120 chart more closely you'll see at the uh
00:20:07.559 below the line uh when the line when the
00:20:10.840 debt GDP ratio is below 250% there is an
00:20:14.320 ample liquidity environment what you
00:20:16.720 tend to find is that below the line you
00:20:19.440 get asset bubbles for me and above the
00:20:22.000 line you start to get financial crises
00:20:24.600 emerging and ideally we track that line
00:20:28.280 Clos ly but you can see there is a cycle
00:20:31.200 what we've had for the last few years is
00:20:33.240 a period where there's been ample
00:20:34.840 liquidity relative to debt that is
00:20:37.720 partly a function of the covid emergency
00:20:40.559 when liquidity was thrown in with
00:20:42.480 alacrity by governments uh and partly
00:20:45.159 the fact that there was a turing out of
00:20:46.880 debt uh by borers uh what you're
00:20:49.520 starting to see now is that debt roll
00:20:51.760 over reemerging uh alongside a period
00:20:54.480 where liquidity is beginning to slow
00:20:56.320 down uh because of what for very various
00:20:58.919 reasons but partly it's because the
00:21:00.880 dollar is going up partly it's because
00:21:02.960 central banks have lost some of it just
00:21:05.080 partly it's because um collateral
00:21:07.720 haircuts are rising because of
00:21:09.039 volatility in bond markets going up but
00:21:11.080 the number of features are slowing down
00:21:12.559 the growth of liquidity relative to this
00:21:15.039 emerging uh maturity
00:21:17.679 War yeah it's very interesting I think
00:21:20.600 what I can gather from what you're
00:21:21.919 telling me is like if I think about that
00:21:24.240 there are two type of there's maybe more
00:21:25.880 the trader type of person who know who
00:21:28.320 know who tries to kind of time these
00:21:30.360 things obviously not to the point where
00:21:32.000 it's always correct but like yeah seeing
00:21:34.679 okay we see that there's some more
00:21:36.320 strain or potential strain emerging in
00:21:38.960 the economy and then you want to kind of
00:21:40.880 play this you know and that's exactly as
00:21:42.520 you said that's probably now a time
00:21:44.640 where you have to look at these numbers
00:21:46.520 as you said we're above the line you
00:21:48.159 know and that could kind of uh signal
00:21:50.640 some stress that is coming our way and
00:21:53.279 then obviously if you're that type of
00:21:54.640 investor yeah you have to be cautious
00:21:56.760 right now and probably I think you I
00:21:58.200 heard say also you can keep on partying
00:22:00.720 but you really have to be close to the
00:22:02.400 doors right because like or maybe
00:22:04.400 already start scaling out and and and is
00:22:06.559 that something that you would would
00:22:08.400 would would still uh uh subscribe to
00:22:10.840 right yeah I think absolutely I mean
00:22:12.440 we're not riskof yet uh but we're
00:22:15.159 basically starting to uh think more
00:22:17.799 prudently uh about uh 2025 and 2025 is
00:22:21.720 going to be a lot tougher than 2024 I
00:22:24.200 mean you know from our standpoint we've
00:22:26.200 been very upbeat on markets very bullish
00:22:28.120 for you know for more than two years now
00:22:31.000 um so we're we're becoming a little bit
00:22:33.440 stale in that in that regard so we got
00:22:35.600 to start thinking about or recognizing
00:22:37.440 the fact there's a cycle and as I said I
00:22:39.360 think there are three major demands on
00:22:41.080 markets on liquidity U over the next uh
00:22:44.480 year or so one is potentially embedded
00:22:47.200 inflation inflation is higher than
00:22:49.679 central banks are currently letting us
00:22:51.400 know or go or stating it it's not 2%
00:22:54.760 it's nearer three and a half percent
00:22:56.400 that may not be the end of the world but
00:22:57.799 clearly it's
00:22:58.960 uh it's a bigger figure than expected uh
00:23:01.400 you've got China which is an uncertain
00:23:04.400 economy right now but China is
00:23:06.480 effectively a dollarized economy we've
00:23:08.200 got to remember and if China needs
00:23:10.480 liquidity it would take it away from the
00:23:12.159 west and then you've got this third
00:23:13.919 point which is the debt maturity War so
00:23:15.919 these are challenges on liquidity that
00:23:18.240 uh were not around in 2025 so in 2024
00:23:21.880 they're there
00:23:22.880 for yes exactly they're now like
00:23:25.320 emerging and it's clearly there but then
00:23:27.720 yeah as I said the second type of
00:23:29.559 investor I'm curious if you would
00:23:32.080 subscribe to this view as well you know
00:23:33.960 or like if you if you think that way you
00:23:35.880 know if you are probably a person who's
00:23:37.640 not that close to the markets you know
00:23:39.720 probably not as close as you and you
00:23:41.039 don't have a mandate of managing other
00:23:43.159 people's money you just manage your own
00:23:44.760 money and then you're like okay I want
00:23:46.480 to be invested because I know I have to
00:23:48.200 be invested also exactly because of the
00:23:50.440 reason that you described you know debt
00:23:52.039 is ever more more growing that's why
00:23:54.080 that also needs to be kind of refinanced
00:23:56.360 and then probably uh yeah through Deb
00:23:58.440 monetization done through banks and
00:24:00.600 central banks and eventually by the
00:24:02.159 government you know and if we know that
00:24:04.360 we have this dichotomy between debt and
00:24:06.799 liquidity and every now and then like
00:24:08.919 liquidity is kind of maybe falling short
00:24:11.799 you know and debt is like increasingly
00:24:14.279 uh almost infin infinitely growing then
00:24:17.080 we know in a long enough time scale yeah
00:24:20.440 if these crisis also show up as we have
00:24:23.000 seen in the past like the powers that be
00:24:25.360 they need to be yeah be to be ready to
00:24:27.600 intervene and exactly uh provide
00:24:30.120 liquidity again to to have some sort of
00:24:32.159 back stop in the system and that's why
00:24:34.000 again it makes probably sense to be if
00:24:36.480 you are just a person as I said who's
00:24:38.120 not really into this long stocks long
00:24:40.440 hard assets like gold and Bitcoin and uh
00:24:43.720 yeah that's that's probably something
00:24:44.919 that you would would argue as well right
00:24:47.520 correct I think you've got to be
00:24:49.039 cognizant both of the trends that are
00:24:51.960 driving markets and the Cycles markets
00:24:54.960 are clearly very cyclical but they're
00:24:56.919 also experiencing trends and what we're
00:24:58.799 seeing is an increasing Trend towards
00:25:01.159 monetary inflation now there's a chart
00:25:03.880 that uh that I've got in the
00:25:05.200 presentation which basically illustrates
00:25:07.520 that monetary inflation background uh
00:25:10.120 what it shows is something we call
00:25:12.360 monetary inflation Hedges which is
00:25:14.760 basically gold and Bitcoin that's how we
00:25:17.240 defined it uh against Global liquidity
00:25:19.960 now if Global liquidity expands by
00:25:21.960 definition that is a monetary inflation
00:25:25.159 okay I use the word monetary inflation
00:25:27.799 because Monet inflation distinguishes it
00:25:30.080 from high streak inflation many people
00:25:32.360 don't distinguish between those two
00:25:34.320 concepts it's very important uh gold is
00:25:37.000 not a High Street inflation hedge
00:25:39.360 necessarily but it's an extremely good
00:25:42.080 monetary hedge but what we're getting is
00:25:44.720 a lot of monetary inflation and some but
00:25:47.919 not overwhelming High streak inflation
00:25:50.440 now on the chart what it shows is a
00:25:53.000 black line which is our projections of
00:25:55.679 global liquidity right from the mid so
00:25:57.919 in the mid 1970s to
00:26:00.760 2025 and the orange line on the chart is
00:26:03.679 the market value of gold and Bitcoin and
00:26:07.120 that seems to track pretty closely uh
00:26:09.799 that Global liquidity Trend now there
00:26:12.159 are clearly Cycles in that uh in that
00:26:14.720 picture and I'm not going to dwell on
00:26:16.520 the Cycles right now I'm just going to
00:26:17.960 focus on the trend and that Trend likely
00:26:20.559 is going upwards and the reason is going
00:26:22.919 upwards is that uh it's explained by
00:26:25.720 debt and the exponential rise of D debt
00:26:28.600 as I said debt needs to be refinanced if
00:26:31.320 it's not refinanced you get uh sovereign
00:26:34.039 debt crisis or refinancing crisis or
00:26:36.080 whatever you like but you get a
00:26:37.559 financial crisis and therefore central
00:26:39.600 banks and policy makers want to avoid
00:26:41.520 that so the way they avoid that is by
00:26:43.559 basically expanding the size of the
00:26:45.159 financial system to facilitate the debt
00:26:47.360 rollovers and to do that you need more
00:26:49.279 balance sheet which means more liquidity
00:26:51.159 so liquidity and debt uh have this uh
00:26:54.000 partnership where they both rise
00:26:55.600 together and therefore uh what we're
00:26:57.919 seeing with a rising debt environment uh
00:27:00.360 is a rising liquidity environment now
00:27:02.080 clearly there'll be Cycles there when
00:27:03.760 they don't exactly match but the trends
00:27:06.080 are lining up and those Trends are
00:27:08.559 driving monetary inflation Hedges Higher
00:27:10.919 and Higher and that's why gold and
00:27:12.720 Bitcoin are going up I'm not saying
00:27:14.520 there's no cycle I'm saying that there
00:27:16.360 is a cycle but there's also an important
00:27:18.240 Trend and just think about this concept
00:27:21.279 uh since year 200000 the stock of
00:27:23.480 American government debt uh treasury
00:27:26.080 debt in to the held by the P the the
00:27:28.320 private sector has increased by eight
00:27:30.919 times since year 2000 the price of gold
00:27:33.760 has gone up by 8 and a quarter times so
00:27:36.159 gold is actually tracked exactly now you
00:27:38.520 could have finessed over that period
00:27:40.279 different Cycles in gold and different
00:27:42.080 Cycles in debt but the trends Stand Out
00:27:45.200 starkly over that 25e period uh there
00:27:48.240 are very few assets that have actually
00:27:50.039 matched that increas in gold and that's
00:27:52.279 what we got to think about in the future
00:27:54.000 if you want to invest over the next 25
00:27:55.919 years and you expect government debt to
00:27:58.159 increased significantly and I would
00:27:59.840 argue that's inevitable because of Aging
00:28:01.840 demographics and the commitments that
00:28:03.679 many governments have made to social
00:28:05.640 spending welfare states Etc uh and
00:28:08.600 increasing debt defense burdens then
00:28:10.960 you've got to expect debt to rise
00:28:13.440 liquidity to rise and the price of gold
00:28:15.760 and Bitcoin to rise over the medium term
00:28:18.760 yeah that's so well explained all these
00:28:21.360 mechanics and how they exactly Edwine
00:28:23.840 yeah that's that's that's that's amazing
00:28:25.480 thanks for this and what I should say is
00:28:27.120 well on the chart there was a dotted
00:28:28.640 line a broken line along the bottom of
00:28:30.399 the chart uh which is US CPI Consumer
00:28:35.039 Price inflation and that line is
00:28:37.600 supposed to distinguish between the
00:28:39.399 monetary inflation in black and the
00:28:41.919 broken line for CPI inflation and
00:28:44.519 therefore what that's trying to say is
00:28:45.919 that monetary inflation is very
00:28:47.440 different from heisted inflation the two
00:28:49.760 may move together but what explains the
00:28:52.360 difference what explains the difference
00:28:54.200 is technological breakthroughs in other
00:28:56.240 words reduced costs higher productivity
00:28:58.559 it could be lower oil prices it could be
00:29:00.720 cheap Chinese products that don't uh in
00:29:03.080 the west all these factors reduce
00:29:05.240 Consumer Price inflation if those
00:29:07.279 factors are not around in the future
00:29:09.679 then what you're likely to see is High
00:29:12.440 Street inflation matching monetary
00:29:14.399 inflation uh for the last 20 30 years
00:29:17.360 they Haven for those reasons yeah
00:29:20.000 exactly that's certainly one of the
00:29:21.159 risks that's always lingering around
00:29:23.000 exactly if we don't have like as you
00:29:24.799 said technological innovation and China
00:29:27.360 we coming with cheap Goods that there
00:29:29.799 who kind of compensate for this for the
00:29:31.600 monetary inflation that we see you know
00:29:33.960 but I mean I I would like to also come
00:29:36.279 back to this cycle the current cycle you
00:29:38.279 know and and like one of the arguments I
00:29:41.159 hear from the the Bulls that still
00:29:43.880 remain or or like at least like one
00:29:45.600 bullish argument that they have is that
00:29:47.600 yeah we've only just started this Global
00:29:49.880 easing cutting cycle you know and and
00:29:51.880 that should improve Global liquidity uh
00:29:54.480 in into the new year as well so what is
00:29:57.240 your view on this is is it really that
00:29:59.279 we are uh in this easing cycle are we
00:30:02.440 still at the beginning or are people
00:30:04.679 getting this
00:30:05.960 wrong well I mean the first thing is
00:30:08.279 people are getting it wrong we've been
00:30:09.480 on easing cycle since October 2022
00:30:12.640 there's no question about that um and
00:30:15.240 that's why financial markets which are a
00:30:17.080 great barometer of monetary
00:30:18.840 accommodation have been going up for so
00:30:20.440 lot uh you know that that's the fact um
00:30:23.840 interest rad are not a gauge of monetary
00:30:26.120 conditions in modern economy uh actual
00:30:28.320 fact you could even argue that higher
00:30:30.159 interest rates uh are actually a source
00:30:32.760 of stimulus now rather than a drag on
00:30:35.240 economies and the simple reason is that
00:30:37.120 the whole backdrop of the flow of funds
00:30:39.159 has changed within the world economy uh
00:30:41.320 you know just consider the US uh
00:30:44.159 treasury debt is High um if interest
00:30:47.679 rates go up on treasury debt there is a
00:30:50.200 huge transfer payment uh from the
00:30:52.679 government to the private sector uh
00:30:55.639 household sector and uh and Institution
00:30:58.799 and that is paid for by taking on more
00:31:01.240 debt quite simply so the debt is disc
00:31:03.360 compounded so every time interest rates
00:31:05.559 go up uh what you see is a boost to us
00:31:08.519 transfer incomes and US incomes so
00:31:10.639 actually paradoxically in the modern
00:31:12.720 world raising interest rates is actually
00:31:14.440 a source of stimulus nor a source of
00:31:16.600 restraint uh that's bizarre people will
00:31:19.080 scratch their heads but that's the
00:31:20.279 reality hey so what we got to recognize
00:31:22.720 here that many things in a world of debt
00:31:25.240 refinancing are Topsy Turvy they're
00:31:27.159 upside down it's like living in an as in
00:31:29.120 one the L world compared to what you're
00:31:30.799 used to but that's the reality we've got
00:31:32.760 to we've got to accept that yeah this is
00:31:35.559 very interesting that you're saying this
00:31:36.960 because I feel like if I talk to many
00:31:39.320 like conventional asset managers and
00:31:41.360 investment committees you know they're
00:31:42.960 still now all focusing on this uh
00:31:45.760 cutting cycle you know and they are
00:31:47.360 really arguing yes this is going to
00:31:49.159 bring uh up Global liquidity again and
00:31:51.639 as you now like eloquently explained
00:31:53.880 this is just maybe not the case and it's
00:31:55.960 uh I'm just wondering when is this going
00:31:57.720 to filter through probably maybe in the
00:32:00.399 next few years or even decades I don't
00:32:02.279 know like at some point people need to
00:32:04.200 adapt because uh as as we as as I said
00:32:07.039 we have people like you and others who
00:32:08.559 are stressing the fact that they might
00:32:10.440 be uh reliant on on on old uh outdated
00:32:13.960 models and and it's just interesting to
00:32:16.440 see because I feel like a lot of
00:32:18.519 investment committees are basing their
00:32:20.720 investment decisions on on stuff like
00:32:23.120 this you know we are now entering a a
00:32:25.600 global liquidity cycle in terms of
00:32:27.960 easing and cutting by the more and more
00:32:30.279 central banks you know they're pointing
00:32:31.679 to all these central banks that are
00:32:33.200 cutting so uh just interesting
00:32:35.720 observation from the I mean the fact is
00:32:38.720 that the price of money is not the rate
00:32:40.320 of interest okay that's the cost of
00:32:42.200 credit uh the price of money is the
00:32:44.559 exchange rate and that's what you've got
00:32:46.279 to start understanding so if the gold
00:32:48.480 price goes up which is the sort of uh
00:32:50.760 price of money par EXL ODS what that's
00:32:52.760 saying is there's abundant money in the
00:32:54.200 system there's abundant liquidity uh if
00:32:56.559 you get the Dollar Rising that's saying
00:32:58.600 that demand for dollar money is actually
00:33:00.919 increasing relative the supply these are
00:33:03.559 things that we need to take into into
00:33:05.279 consideration but what you're seeing uh
00:33:07.840 particularly in the dollar world is an
00:33:10.159 emergence of an issue that we've seen
00:33:12.799 many times before in the world economy
00:33:15.200 which is an emergent bubble and we've
00:33:17.120 got to be very cognisant of that because
00:33:19.760 trees don't grow into the sky and bubbl
00:33:21.880 St inflate forever and what you're
00:33:24.120 seeing is an adjustment mechanism uh in
00:33:26.559 the dollar that we saw uh maybe
00:33:28.760 originally in Japan in the 1980s but was
00:33:31.760 carried through into emerging Asia uh in
00:33:34.279 the late 19 uh in sorry mid 1990s and
00:33:37.559 got carried through to China uh after
00:33:39.679 the GFC uh these are factors that we've
00:33:42.080 seen many many times before and they
00:33:43.559 come back to Capital flows now the thing
00:33:45.799 to remember uh when you're trying to
00:33:48.159 understand the Dynamics or the drivers
00:33:50.080 of global liquidity is that crossb flows
00:33:52.519 are a very important element now what we
00:33:55.559 need to understand in this context is
00:33:57.360 the and really what's going on and the
00:34:00.120 fact that the dollar is going up uh is
00:34:02.399 maybe contrary to what people have
00:34:03.919 thought about uh in this upcoming Trump
00:34:07.159 presidency because Trump has been very
00:34:09.280 vocal to say that he wants a weaker
00:34:11.239 dollar but the reality is the markets
00:34:13.040 are giving him a stronger dollar and I
00:34:15.320 think the fact is that the markets are
00:34:16.918 right because the policies that Trump
00:34:19.000 are is enacting are basically pro-
00:34:21.399 dollar policies and I rather suspect
00:34:23.679 that proposed treasury secretary Scott
00:34:26.440 Besson is actually a hard money Mone man
00:34:28.760 and if he is a hard money man what we
00:34:30.599 may be seeing is that uh Jerome Pal's
00:34:33.960 tenor uh at the um that the Federal
00:34:38.000 Reserve is actually quite shortlived uh
00:34:40.079 he'll be replaced soon uh because I
00:34:42.079 don't believe he's a hard money man I
00:34:43.679 think that any Central Bank that talks
00:34:45.599 about transitory inflation uh as Jerome
00:34:48.399 pal did back in 2021 is a central bank
00:34:51.839 doesn't want a Titan and that's patanty
00:34:54.199 obvious for much of the last two or
00:34:55.960 three years the Federal Reserve has been
00:34:57.839 basically adding liquidity to the system
00:34:59.920 although it's been in denial but that's
00:35:01.520 the reality now if we go dollar let's
00:35:04.560 should we talk about the dollar because
00:35:06.000 the dollar I think is the Cent yeah
00:35:07.359 maybe I I would love to talk about the
00:35:09.079 dollar as well but maybe just one last
00:35:11.119 thing because one thing I'm hearing as
00:35:13.000 well is in terms of QT you know like
00:35:15.320 that's QT QE that's like these terms
00:35:17.800 that are being thrown around as well and
00:35:19.640 some people are like yeah we're
00:35:20.920 expecting the end of QT you know because
00:35:23.240 they're still thinking we're doing like
00:35:25.040 outride QT and we might be like a if if
00:35:27.920 you look at it uh superficially but I
00:35:30.119 think you and others have also argued
00:35:31.760 that there has been some sort of stealth
00:35:33.640 QT going on you know but like what if uh
00:35:36.720 the FED is actually considering lowering
00:35:39.760 uh or or ending QT at at some point you
00:35:42.359 know uh in 2025 wouldn't that also then
00:35:45.160 again be kind of bullish for liquidity
00:35:47.160 or is that the wrong way to think about
00:35:48.960 it well I think it's certainly not
00:35:51.920 bearish for liquidity that that's for
00:35:53.640 sure what I'm trying to say is that
00:35:55.640 there are increasing demands on that
00:35:57.160 liquidity people so it's not such uh so
00:36:00.280 straightforward as it would have been in
00:36:01.680 2024 or 2023 so you've got an increasing
00:36:05.200 SP not I'm not denying the fact that you
00:36:07.520 will likely get more fed liquidity I
00:36:09.720 think that's very much the reality I
00:36:11.760 think you may get more fed liquidity
00:36:13.599 against the background where there are
00:36:14.960 very few if any interest rate Cuts in
00:36:17.160 the US so I think that the fed's balance
00:36:19.359 sheet will expand again but let's be
00:36:21.200 clear what's been going on for the last
00:36:23.280 two to three years in fact principally
00:36:25.240 since October of 2022 is so what you've
00:36:28.000 seen in America is a concept that we
00:36:29.760 have called or flippantly called not
00:36:32.640 qeqe and as operator alongside policy
00:36:36.359 treasury is enacted which is called not
00:36:38.480 yield curve control yield curve control
00:36:40.640 so other words they've been denying what
00:36:42.280 they've been doing but they've been
00:36:43.319 doing it sort of su taer and that is the
00:36:46.119 reality interestingly enough um uh Scott
00:36:49.720 bessent in his hedge fund um basically
00:36:53.560 identified these threats uh a few months
00:36:56.760 ago and he said that Powell and Janet
00:36:59.599 Yellen were basically colluding to get
00:37:02.760 Biden reelected and what they've been
00:37:05.079 doing is subtly injecting liquidity into
00:37:08.119 the system and that is boy markets now
00:37:10.520 he spotted that very few other
00:37:13.040 investment managers as far as we know
00:37:15.160 were uh as that Keen uh that Keen on the
00:37:18.119 on the subject they weren't so quick
00:37:20.440 witted but effectively what you've seen
00:37:23.240 is this stitious easy now how has it
00:37:25.800 been done by the Federal Reserve it's
00:37:27.760 been done because uh every item on the
00:37:30.319 balance sheet is not liquidity creating
00:37:33.040 uh so the balance sheet May well have
00:37:34.400 been shrinking but the fact is you've
00:37:36.319 got to identify which elements of the
00:37:38.200 balance sheet create liquidity in money
00:37:39.880 markets and which don't and what you've
00:37:41.800 seen uh is the liquidity creating
00:37:44.880 elements in the balance sheet have
00:37:46.160 actually expanded so the balance sheet
00:37:48.040 may have shrunk in size but liquidity of
00:37:50.319 the Federal Reserve has increased
00:37:52.040 evidence Rising Bank Reserves uh bank
00:37:55.359 reserve levels are basically identif fir
00:37:57.720 the amount of money that's washing
00:37:58.839 around in US money markets and that's
00:38:00.800 been going up so obviously the FED has
00:38:02.920 been injecting liquidity uh second thing
00:38:05.280 is that if you look at what's happened
00:38:06.599 at the treasury Janet Yellen has been
00:38:08.960 extremely clever I would say because
00:38:11.599 what she's done is she skewed the
00:38:13.400 calendar of issuance towards bills uh
00:38:16.800 treasury bills and short dat debt now
00:38:20.040 why is that important one of the reasons
00:38:22.079 is that you can technically Define
00:38:24.400 liquidity uh in terms of the ratio
00:38:26.720 between the stock of assets and their
00:38:28.480 duration that ratio so if you uh let's
00:38:32.480 say keep the stock of assets the same
00:38:34.800 but you decrease the average duration
00:38:37.480 what you're getting is a liquidity boost
00:38:39.760 and you can see that best in terms of
00:38:42.160 understanding who owns or who holds
00:38:44.359 bills and short dated government debt
00:38:47.119 and the answer is it's largely Banks or
00:38:48.800 credit providers because that gives an
00:38:50.480 immediate offset to a deposit that's
00:38:52.599 coming maybe from government spending
00:38:54.960 and what you see is Banks and uh well
00:38:57.920 Banks generally but Banks and credit
00:38:59.920 providers basically increasing their
00:39:02.400 Holdings of treasuries and agency
00:39:04.760 Securities significantly and what that
00:39:07.240 is doing is monetizing the government
00:39:10.160 deficit but it's also helping to Boler
00:39:13.400 conventional monetary Aggregates but
00:39:15.160 this is what's happening they're subtly
00:39:16.839 injecting liquidity into the system now
00:39:20.280 is there a cost to doing that yes there
00:39:22.480 is the cost is that more and more of the
00:39:25.119 US government is being funded at the
00:39:26.640 short end so it makes makes them very
00:39:29.240 very sensitive to changes in the
00:39:30.760 interest Bill and increasing interest
00:39:32.920 rate so the interest Bill we know now is
00:39:35.680 escalating fast uh it's over a trillion
00:39:38.800 US Dollars it is slated to go up 20%
00:39:41.880 next year uh simply because of the
00:39:44.079 rollover of debt 30% of US debt is
00:39:47.040 likely be rolled in 2025 so you get the
00:39:49.920 idea that effectively uh you know what
00:39:53.319 uh what has happened here is that Yellen
00:39:55.000 has made Scott besson's job very very
00:39:57.760 difficult now uh what does that mean
00:40:01.200 does it mean Scott bessin comes into the
00:40:03.160 treasury and he says enough is enough
00:40:05.359 we're not going to cheat anymore uh
00:40:07.240 we're going to start going to go back
00:40:08.880 and fund at the long end well I think if
00:40:11.040 he did that it would be a disaster for
00:40:12.839 Wall Street uh it would take a lot of
00:40:14.760 liquidity out of the markets and it
00:40:16.160 would upset his boss um you know Donald
00:40:18.599 Trump so I don't believe he's going to
00:40:20.240 do that I think he's going to run with
00:40:21.520 his policy for longer but I think he's
00:40:23.359 going to put a different person at the
00:40:25.160 fed or engineer a different person at
00:40:26.920 the Fed somebody who is a lot tougher on
00:40:29.280 inflation more of an inflation Hall and
00:40:31.599 so he can basically forward guide the
00:40:33.480 markets uh to a view that they are
00:40:36.400 anti-inflation but at the same time they
00:40:38.359 can allow the balance sheet to expand
00:40:40.400 that would be my my view was something a
00:40:43.599 strong dollar yeah exactly and and just
00:40:47.200 to to add to this is this also related
00:40:49.480 in terms like we've recently seen like
00:40:51.720 if we if we see or from the FED minutes
00:40:54.240 you know when we take a look that the
00:40:55.599 FED is reconsidering like lowering the
00:40:58.599 award rate on reserve repos you know on
00:41:01.000 the reserve repo facility to kind of
00:41:02.920 push Capital out or the remaining
00:41:04.640 Capital that's still in there I think
00:41:05.960 it's about 200 billion and we've been
00:41:08.319 hovering around this level for quite
00:41:10.000 some time as far as I'm informed and
00:41:11.839 they maybe by doing this are trying to
00:41:14.599 kind of push the capital out of this
00:41:16.160 facility back into the market uh sort of
00:41:19.079 like improving bank reserve liquidity
00:41:21.040 which then could also be serving as a
00:41:23.440 sort of absorber for for for the debt
00:41:25.880 that you just described is this
00:41:27.319 connected at all or or what are your
00:41:29.319 thoughts there yeah I mean they
00:41:30.920 completely connected I mean the fact is
00:41:32.599 that what what we can see from
00:41:34.079 everything I've just described is that
00:41:36.040 the treasury and the FED not only are
00:41:37.599 they working closely together but
00:41:39.200 they're absolutely focused on liquidity
00:41:41.839 question um you know to say that
00:41:44.119 liquidity doesn't matter basically you
00:41:46.079 know denies what policy makers have been
00:41:48.599 doing for for much of the last 10 years
00:41:51.359 they've been absolutely focused uh 100%
00:41:54.520 on liquidity question this is key it's
00:41:56.839 key to understanding these markets and
00:41:58.960 the fact that they are reducing interest
00:42:00.960 rates on the reverse repo is basically
00:42:03.240 saying that they want to run that
00:42:04.599 reverse repo down as much as they can so
00:42:07.280 that will be a source of liquidity going
00:42:08.839 to markets on top of that you've got
00:42:10.920 something called the treasury general
00:42:12.480 account which is the treasury's Holdings
00:42:14.760 of cash deposit at the Federal Reserve
00:42:17.119 money that is not circulating if you
00:42:19.119 like yet and if they run down that
00:42:21.599 treasury general account uh which I
00:42:23.760 think that what they will be forced to
00:42:25.200 do ahead of the debt ceiling or reos I
00:42:27.440 on January the 2nd uh that will be
00:42:29.920 something like 400 to 500 billion uh
00:42:33.319 dollars injected back into financial
00:42:35.000 markets so I think you have got very
00:42:36.960 good grounds for arguing that liquidity
00:42:38.640 is coming in and the reason I think
00:42:40.400 they're doing that is they can see that
00:42:42.640 banks are probably struggling with
00:42:44.640 Reserves at where they are now at about
00:42:46.240 three and a quarter trillion dollars uh
00:42:48.599 that is not sufficient uh to keep you
00:42:51.839 know keep the system running there's a
00:42:53.760 risk of financial trouble uh if it gets
00:42:56.119 much lower the other thing they did
00:42:58.040 which has not got very much publicity at
00:43:00.119 all surprisingly is they changed the
00:43:02.280 rules on bank stren stress tests and
00:43:04.680 what they what they did in August was
00:43:06.400 allowed the banks to basically use more
00:43:08.280 and more treasury collateral uh to
00:43:10.480 borrow whether it's from the discount
00:43:11.960 window uh or from the standing repo
00:43:14.839 facility or they could borrow from the
00:43:16.760 federal home loan Banks all these things
00:43:18.680 basically uh are saying that Banks can
00:43:20.599 hold more treasuries and please do hold
00:43:22.720 more treasuries we'd rather like that uh
00:43:25.400 but these are if you like bending the
00:43:26.800 rules to get more liquidity in the
00:43:28.240 system just another way to engineer
00:43:30.440 Financial uh like debt monetization as
00:43:32.720 you described just elegantly that's
00:43:34.359 that's exactly it well I mean you know
00:43:36.839 when it when we come back to the dollar
00:43:38.760 like this the strong dollar or the weak
00:43:40.400 dollar whatever I mean what what's that
00:43:43.160 change of heart by Trump where did it
00:43:45.160 come from you know because I feel like
00:43:47.119 um as you said like he was rather known
00:43:49.520 for for having a weak dollar I I also
00:43:51.760 think like wice President JD Ben when he
00:43:54.440 was kind of introduced like a lot of
00:43:56.079 people were were like talks that he has
00:43:58.319 given that where he was absolutely like
00:44:01.559 vouching for for a weaker dollar but why
00:44:04.880 why now it seems like uh dollar or Trump
00:44:08.200 and his administration is going for a
00:44:10.240 stronger dollar at least like in the
00:44:11.800 past few weeks it has it has looked uh
00:44:14.839 it has looked that way why the change of
00:44:17.200 heart well I think the first thing to
00:44:19.640 say is that uh a lot of the policies
00:44:21.839 that Trump is aning are basically Pro
00:44:24.559 dollar anyway uh so let let's clear
00:44:27.359 about that uh scottt Besson very
00:44:29.520 eloquently said recently that actually
00:44:31.680 Trump's policies are deflationary not
00:44:34.119 inflationary and I I basically got some
00:44:36.319 sympathy with that that's probably
00:44:37.920 correct I think the other thing that
00:44:39.720 you've got to say is that the other
00:44:41.720 point that Scott Besson is also
00:44:43.240 eloquently made is that if you look
00:44:45.760 around the world uh at International
00:44:48.160 politics what you find is that voters
00:44:50.240 tend to tend to uh kick out politicians
00:44:53.640 that have overseen high inflation and uh
00:44:56.880 that must be a lesson uh for Trump in
00:44:59.839 the upcoming 2026 midterm elections so
00:45:02.880 if he wants to hold on to the house uh
00:45:05.200 even to cement his majority even further
00:45:07.920 what he's got to do is to control
00:45:09.400 inflation you can't let inflation run
00:45:11.280 away and Janet Yellen is basically you
00:45:13.839 know made the job rather tougher and
00:45:15.839 that's why I think that the focus of
00:45:17.680 Bess and Trump is likely to be on
00:45:20.280 keeping inflation expectations low which
00:45:22.760 is why I think they're going to not
00:45:25.440 sanctional they would rather rather not
00:45:27.440 sanction the Federal Reserve cutting
00:45:29.680 interest rates too much uh and I think
00:45:31.920 they need a tougher fed chare in there
00:45:35.760 uh someone who can actually espouse this
00:45:38.000 or forward guide the mar markets I
00:45:40.079 should say towards a low inflation
00:45:41.800 outcome so that that would be my
00:45:43.680 thinking now in terms of the dollar uh
00:45:46.400 as I said everything is underpinning the
00:45:48.040 dollar but then you've also got to
00:45:50.160 understand the background here uh in
00:45:52.359 terms of the trends and there's a slide
00:45:55.079 that I've got in the pack I sent you
00:45:57.200 which is which is entitled net inflows
00:45:59.520 into the US dollar uh which is basically
00:46:02.119 a graph that shows the movements of
00:46:05.000 capital into the US uh over the last 20
00:46:08.359 years now the point about showing that
00:46:10.520 chart is it's not coming from the US
00:46:13.400 side uh in other words doesn't come from
00:46:15.920 uh chicks data published by the US
00:46:18.079 Treasury this is data which comes from
00:46:20.400 other countries with are saying what
00:46:22.599 they invest in US assets and that's
00:46:24.680 likely to be more accurate because the
00:46:26.920 us numbers uh under count the inflows of
00:46:29.640 the dollar and what this basically
00:46:31.440 illustrates is a significant surch of
00:46:33.760 money coming into the dollar uh
00:46:36.200 basically after the global financial
00:46:38.280 crisis not only is that uh number
00:46:41.559 positive uh but it's actually looks like
00:46:43.720 it's starting to accelerate again and
00:46:46.240 that inflow has been un uh has been
00:46:48.359 underwritten by a number of features one
00:46:50.520 is America's technological leadership
00:46:52.880 one is the fact that uh uh the rules on
00:46:55.800 banks of chams they they they required
00:46:58.280 to hold a lot more safe assets and be
00:47:00.200 tighter regulated which means holding
00:47:02.119 more us Treasures uh you've had the
00:47:04.240 Eurozone banking crisis which basically
00:47:06.160 put a nail in the coffin of the Euro as
00:47:08.240 a reserve asset you've had the Chinese
00:47:11.359 uh anti-corruption Crackdown which meant
00:47:13.640 a lot of money went out of China into
00:47:15.640 the dollar uh EXA the covid crisis you
00:47:18.720 name it everything has really been uh
00:47:21.359 Pro the dollar and most Capital inflows
00:47:23.559 are significant now if you look at the
00:47:25.800 following chart what that shows is my
00:47:28.960 preferred measure of the
00:47:31.680 dollar which is the real trade weighted
00:47:35.440 uh exchange rate basket real means
00:47:37.880 that's inflation adjusted and what you
00:47:40.319 can see here is a situation where there
00:47:43.079 has been a very noticeable Trend change
00:47:46.280 around the time of the GFC now I can't
00:47:49.839 see any thread to that upward Trend in
00:47:52.800 the dollar uh you know from the data is
00:47:56.480 not it's not breaking down it looks like
00:47:59.160 it's well embedded that trend is going
00:48:01.040 up people are investing in the dollar
00:48:03.079 now what you've got to think about is
00:48:05.280 how that mechanism uh drives Capital
00:48:09.440 markets in the period from the mid 1960s
00:48:13.760 right the way through to the GFC the
00:48:15.920 dollar was weak that weakness in um in
00:48:19.920 the real exchange rate basically came
00:48:22.200 through in terms of monetary policy
00:48:24.119 actions and what it meant was that
00:48:26.359 forign central banks could ease it meant
00:48:29.839 that the Federal Reserve because it was
00:48:32.680 not really prepared to allow the dollar
00:48:34.960 to or didn't want the dollar to go up
00:48:36.800 very much was quite prepared to allow it
00:48:39.119 to fall was easing at the same time and
00:48:41.800 so what you had was all central banks
00:48:43.880 were running easy monetary policies
00:48:46.040 against the background of a weakening
00:48:47.440 dollar right that was that was the best
00:48:50.559 time for Global liquidity Global
00:48:52.160 liquidity is abundant and financial
00:48:54.200 assets went up hugely right since the
00:48:57.280 GFC what you've seen is a very
00:48:59.079 significant change in the Dynamics and
00:49:01.400 those Dynamics have basically been one
00:49:03.720 where you've had Rising real exchange
00:49:06.240 rate for the US dollar now in my book
00:49:08.880 Capital Wars I articulated how that
00:49:11.119 mechanism is translated and what it
00:49:13.640 means is if the real exchange rate is
00:49:15.880 rising either the nominal dollar goes up
00:49:19.520 Andor us prices go up now what we know
00:49:23.599 is that goods and service prices are
00:49:25.640 sticky and most prices the adjust of
00:49:28.920 financial asset prices so in a rising
00:49:31.760 real exchange rate environment you get
00:49:33.839 the cocktail of a rising nominal dollar
00:49:36.920 and Rising us asset prices and that's
00:49:40.000 exactly what we've had now in that
00:49:43.520 situation the counter the other side of
00:49:46.119 the coin is a falling R exchange rate in
00:49:48.799 the Euro area in Japan and in China and
00:49:53.119 what's happened is that their nominal
00:49:54.640 exchange rates have gone down and all
00:49:57.079 their asset prices have gone down
00:49:58.920 certainly relative to the US uh that's
00:50:01.240 been unmistakable and in cases in
00:50:03.079 absolute terms too if those central
00:50:05.520 banks are even more robust in wanting to
00:50:08.359 hold their currencies up against the
00:50:10.160 strong dollar Vis China then what they
00:50:12.839 out is an even tighter monetary stance
00:50:15.440 and that tighter monetary stance creates
00:50:17.440 huge deflation domestically and it
00:50:19.559 causes asset prices ASO price collapses
00:50:22.680 so what we're seeing here is the
00:50:25.200 absolute uh clear unfolding of a real
00:50:28.319 exchange rate adjustment mechanism that
00:50:30.520 will keep going in this direction until
00:50:32.520 it doesn't and what will arrest the rise
00:50:35.440 in the dollar or sorry arrest the rise
00:50:38.440 in Wall Street and the US dollar is
00:50:40.799 basically some reversal in capital flows
00:50:43.480 and or the Federal Reserve jumping hard
00:50:45.920 on the break because of an inflation
00:50:47.599 problem so what ends uh the US bubble is
00:50:51.000 an inflation pickup pretty much like
00:50:53.319 ended the Japanese bubble in 1989 when
00:50:56.920 left field nobody was focusing on
00:50:59.559 inflation in 1989 Japan because the rice
00:51:03.000 price which dominated the CPI was
00:51:06.799 unchanged yeah I think if I remember
00:51:09.040 rightly the price of rice bizar was 25%
00:51:12.359 of the CPI and it didn't change and that
00:51:14.799 kept inflation low and what happened was
00:51:17.240 moo the Central Bank Governor decided to
00:51:20.079 tighten policy aggressively because he
00:51:21.839 said service sector inflation was
00:51:23.880 accelerating well no one in Japan had
00:51:25.960 ever heard of service sector inflation
00:51:27.680 for but that's what gave them the excuse
00:51:30.119 he hit the brakes hard uh caused the yen
00:51:32.760 to spike higher and a huge a
00:51:35.160 deflationary hit to the economy which it
00:51:37.200 took them 20 years to get over and that
00:51:39.720 is the background then exactly the same
00:51:42.079 thing happened in emerging Asia in uh in
00:51:45.079 the late 1990s then it was foreign
00:51:47.880 investors that pulled the plug and what
00:51:50.040 we're seeing now is the similar bubble
00:51:51.720 unfolding in the case of us assets uh as
00:51:54.400 I say enjoy the party but d near the
00:51:56.920 door because this is not going to go on
00:51:58.680 forever but what you've got to
00:52:00.520 understand is the Dynamics behind the
00:52:02.040 dollar and I think the best want a
00:52:04.839 strong dollar and I think a dollar
00:52:06.559 dollar strength is part of that policy
00:52:08.880 and in the final slide that I sent you I
00:52:12.000 put a little schematic diagram that
00:52:14.400 basically tried to uh understand uh
00:52:18.040 Scott besson's policy from my
00:52:19.880 perspective anyway what that diagram
00:52:22.079 basically illustrates is that what they
00:52:24.359 do is that they uh they take
00:52:26.920 deregulation they undertake increasing
00:52:29.440 tariffs that un that underpins the
00:52:31.880 exchange rate the strong exchange rate
00:52:33.880 brings inflation down and because
00:52:36.040 inflation is coming down it makes the
00:52:37.599 funding job much much easier uh for the
00:52:40.680 government of the treasury to undertake
00:52:42.880 uh and that's basically the sort of the
00:52:44.760 virtuous circle that you may be seeing
00:52:46.960 under Trump too if it applies apply an
00:52:50.079 inflation picks up then uh you know then
00:52:53.559 run for the
00:52:54.920 hills yeah that's oh that's that's a lot
00:52:57.480 to take in but so interesting I mean I
00:52:59.359 was just like now thinking myself you
00:53:01.760 know the the things that you were saying
00:53:03.799 and some things that kind of light bald
00:53:05.920 that went off is really like yeah if if
00:53:07.839 we have this situation you know that you
00:53:10.000 just described that it seems to be uh
00:53:12.079 ongoing that the dollar is is not
00:53:14.200 weaking but strengthening and there is
00:53:16.040 no no real reason to assume that this
00:53:18.240 will break anytime soon this trend you
00:53:20.160 know then as you said it's the dollar
00:53:22.040 going up as well as US market or us
00:53:24.720 assets but then also for me like
00:53:27.319 somebody's really interested in Bitcoin
00:53:29.319 you know I think this is also something
00:53:31.400 that people need to understand as you
00:53:33.280 said that the Dynamics here might be
00:53:34.720 changing especially like because like as
00:53:37.359 I said like historically it's been the
00:53:40.160 case that if the dollar is strong
00:53:41.799 Bitcoin is is kind of weak you know but
00:53:44.240 for the last few weeks this has not
00:53:45.760 really held and maybe in 2025 this is
00:53:48.359 not not going to hold that much uh
00:53:51.520 longer obviously we maybe have these uh
00:53:54.200 periods where where you have some
00:53:55.720 corrections because whenever like as you
00:53:57.559 said then also Financial uh crisis
00:54:00.520 rumors are are are rampant again then
00:54:03.440 maybe you get some fire sales and you
00:54:05.319 you would have great U entry prices
00:54:07.680 again for Bitcoin and and other hard
00:54:09.520 assets but one last point that I want to
00:54:11.400 make on bitcoin especially now that
00:54:13.240 you're saying you know this us asset
00:54:15.960 Market it's it's all connected now my
00:54:18.599 thinking is and that's probably also why
00:54:20.640 it now makes sense to me that a lot of
00:54:22.440 people within the US also within the
00:54:24.640 Trump government they have been really V
00:54:26.640 on bitcoin and Bitcoin is almost
00:54:28.720 becoming a sort of like adjacent asset
00:54:31.760 to the US market especially if something
00:54:33.680 like a strategic Bitcoin Reserve were
00:54:35.559 will come to pass you know it's the
00:54:37.520 Sailor play on on the US government
00:54:39.640 where they hold Bitcoin then it's even
00:54:41.960 more correlated to us uh Equity markets
00:54:45.040 I would assume which would then in the
00:54:47.040 scenario that you just described be be
00:54:49.079 positive for for Bitcoin at least you
00:54:50.880 know and that's just a thought that kind
00:54:52.440 of uh was running through my mind now
00:54:55.359 you know because they're kind of
00:54:56.559 americanizing Bitcoin in that sense it's
00:54:58.839 probably not in the interest of all the
00:55:00.240 bitcoiners but price-wise it it could be
00:55:03.040 interesting for sure
00:55:05.079 anding stable coin makes all huge sense
00:55:08.839 yeah
00:55:09.520 that's increase in demand for treasury
00:55:12.040 Securities I mean that that's got to
00:55:13.799 happen anyone who's got any sort of
00:55:15.680 joined up thinking in in the American
00:55:17.400 Administration has got to go for uh you
00:55:19.680 know uh formalizing stable coins role
00:55:22.599 but I think that you know let let me be
00:55:24.079 clear there's there's no reason why the
00:55:25.960 dollar can't go up and Bitcoin and gold
00:55:28.119 can go up as well that that's for sure
00:55:30.640 that's on the basis that liquidity in
00:55:32.480 the US keeps rising and as I say what's
00:55:35.240 driving um what's driving the uh rise in
00:55:38.640 Bitcoin and gold is monetary inflation
00:55:41.000 what's driving the dollar is increasing
00:55:43.000 Capital ships into US assets so there's
00:55:45.760 no reason all three can't go up uh you
00:55:48.119 know we've seen a different Dynamic
00:55:49.839 historically but that's very different
00:55:51.240 reasons what ends the party if is if us
00:55:54.079 liquidity starts to come down heavily if
00:55:56.400 us liquidity comes down remember it's
00:55:58.319 cyclical then you're going to get the
00:56:00.039 dollar coming down uh potentially um
00:56:03.160 you're going to get or maybe a bit later
00:56:05.240 but you'll first see the gold price
00:56:07.480 collapsing and Bitcoin collapsing and we
00:56:09.559 know that they're highly volatile so
00:56:11.480 these are things that you really need to
00:56:13.200 be taken into consideration liquidity is
00:56:15.480 all important in this
00:56:17.480 equation yeah great well Michael I think
00:56:20.200 we've gone for almost an hour so uh I
00:56:22.319 want to be conscious of your time so

00:56:32.599 some light bulbs uh definitely went went
00:56:35.200 off again or on so to say that I can
00:56:37.400 kind of like think about and and and
00:56:39.799 yeah and meditate on as well all these
00:56:42.000 things that you shared with us so thanks

00:57:13.359 to mind I think the uh I think somebody
