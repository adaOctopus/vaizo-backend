[OFFICIAL DOCUMENT]

Crypto Market Indicators and How to read them in order to define if the crypto market has reached a cycle top or not yet.

[Important Note before we go into the indicators]

All the indicators are of equal significance and we need to take them all into account in order to answer the following questions:

=> Should we take profits from the market? 
=> Has the market crypto cycle reached its top?
=> Is there more room for upside?
=> From the Top 20 Cryptos in CoinMarketCap which ones are a good opportunity to buy?




NOW WE ARE READY TO GO THROUGH ALL THE INDICATORS MENTIONED BELOW. THEY ARE 28  CRYPTO MARKET INDICATORS.
READ THEM CAREFULLY. First, there is the name of the indicator after the number (i.e 1. AVIV, 2. MVRV Z-Score etc) and below you can see the tag [HOW TO READ] and below it is the explanation of how to read
the indicator in order to make decisions. Once we have the data from the APIs and the value of each indicator, read carefully through each indicator and how to read it. And based on the value and the explanation give an answer to the following question:

"QUESTION: Has the market cycle reached the top? Should I take profits, or wait a bit as there is more room for upside?"

1. AVIV ratio

[HOW TO READ IT]

The AVIV Ratio is a market indicator that compares Bitcoin's active capitalization (ActiveCap) to its investor capitalization (InvestorCap). Here's how you can interpret it to determine if the crypto market cycle is approaching a top:

Above 250%: Indicates that Bitcoin is significantly overvalued. Historically, this level has aligned with market tops, followed by recessions or major corrections.
Below 55%: Suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued and typically marks a bullish period or market bottom.
The ratio emphasizes the actions of active market participants by accounting for coins in motion and ignoring dormant ones, offering a real-time snapshot of market sentiment and valuation. The current AVIV ratio can be tracked using tools like BGeometrics【255】【257】【259】.

Let me know if you'd like help analyzing this or other market indicators in more depth!



2. MVRV Zscore

[HOW TO READ IT]

The MVRV Z-Score is a powerful on-chain indicator used to assess whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical market trends. Here's how to interpret it to identify market cycle tops:

Above 7:

When the Z-Score exceeds 7, it indicates Bitcoin is significantly overvalued.
Historically, this level aligns with market cycle tops and precedes corrections or bear markets.
Between 0 and 7:

Indicates a neutral to moderately bullish phase.
Suggests the market has potential room for further price increases before reaching overvaluation territory.
Below 0:

Indicates Bitcoin is undervalued.
This range often corresponds to market bottoms or accumulation phases.
The Z-Score is calculated by comparing the market value (current market cap) and realized value (aggregate value of all coins at the price they last moved) while accounting for historical volatility.

To monitor the current MVRV Z-Score, platforms like Glassnode and BGeometrics provide updated data. Let me know if you'd like further insights on how to use it in your strategy!



3. Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD)

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD) indicator reflects Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Here's how to interpret it to assess whether the crypto market cycle is nearing a top:

Sharp Increase in BTCD:

When Bitcoin dominance rises sharply, it often signals a shift of capital back to Bitcoin from altcoins.
This occurs during the late stages of a bull market, when investors seek safety in Bitcoin before significant profit-taking.
Decline in BTCD After a Peak:

When Bitcoin dominance starts to decline after a sharp rise, it may indicate that altcoins are outperforming.
This often aligns with the market's euphoric phase, suggesting the cycle top is approaching or has been reached.
Low and Stagnant BTCD:

A prolonged decline in dominance can suggest a strong altcoin season or bear market conditions, as capital rotates into riskier assets or exits the market.
Tracking BTCD alongside other indicators like MVRV Z-Score and on-chain metrics can provide a clearer picture of market conditions. Platforms like CoinMarketCap or TradingView offer real-time Bitcoin dominance charts for analysis.

4. Realized Loss Short Term Holder (STH)

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Realized Loss Short Term Holder (STH) indicator helps to identify market cycle tops by analyzing the realized losses of short-term Bitcoin holders (those who have held BTC for less than 155 days). Here's how to read it:

Spike in Realized Losses:
When short-term holders realize significant losses, it indicates increased selling pressure from this group. This often aligns with or follows market cycle tops as prices start to decline.

Sustained Loss Levels:
Prolonged high realized losses among short-term holders suggest capitulation, often a bearish signal. However, if losses subside, it may indicate that the majority of weak hands have exited, reducing selling pressure【269】【271】【273】.

You can track this indicator on platforms like CryptoQuant or Glassnode, which provide detailed on-chain metrics. These tools allow you to observe trends in short-term holder behavior to anticipate potential market shifts. Let me know if you'd like further insights or assistance!


5. Realized Loss Long Term Holder (LTH)

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Realized Loss Long Term Holder (LTH) indicator is a powerful tool to gauge the crypto market's cycle phase, particularly identifying tops. Here's how to interpret it:

Spikes in Realized Losses:
When long-term holders (those holding assets for over 155 days) realize significant losses, it typically occurs during corrections or bear market phases. However, smaller spikes during bullish runs can indicate profit-taking, especially if coinciding with market euphoria.

Sustained Loss Levels:
Persistent high realized losses often align with a market peak. This suggests long-term holders are exiting their positions en masse, signaling reduced confidence in further upward movement【280】【281】.

Historical Patterns:
In previous cycles, major spikes in long-term holder losses closely preceded cycle tops. Tracking these spikes alongside other indicators, like MVRV Z-Score and SOPR, can provide additional confirmation【282】【283】.

For live data and analysis, tools like Glassnode or CryptoQuant provide detailed metrics on this indicator. Let me know if you'd like help tracking these patterns or integrating the data into your analysis!


6. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is a key on-chain indicator used to measure the profitability of coins being moved on the blockchain. It provides insights into market sentiment and helps identify potential cycle tops. Here's how to interpret it:

SOPR > 1:

Indicates that coins being moved are selling at a profit (their selling price is higher than the price at which they were acquired).
When SOPR remains persistently above 1 during a bullish phase, it signals profit-taking. Sustained high SOPR values can precede a market cycle top.
SOPR < 1:

Suggests that coins are being sold at a loss. This is common in bear markets or during corrections.
Flatlining or Declining SOPR > 1:

A flat or declining SOPR above 1 can indicate a weakening rally, as fewer participants are taking profits. This often happens before market tops.
Sharp Spikes in SOPR:

Sudden and significant increases in SOPR values may signal a heightened period of profit-taking, typically near market cycle tops​

7. Realized Profit Long-Term Holder (LTH) 

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Realized Profit Long-Term Holder (LTH) indicator measures the profit realized by long-term Bitcoin holders when they sell their coins. Here's how to interpret it to assess market cycle tops:

Spikes in Realized Profits by LTH:

When long-term holders take significant profits, it often indicates a euphoric phase in the market.
Historically, major profit-taking by LTH aligns closely with market tops, as these holders are typically the last to sell during bull runs【291】【293】.
Sustained Profit Realization:

Prolonged periods of high realized profits by LTH suggest that a market top is either forming or already in place.
Tracking Platforms:

You can monitor this indicator on platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant for real-time insights and historical context【294】【295】.
By analyzing these spikes alongside other metrics like the MVRV Z-Score or SOPR, you can better determine whether the market is nearing a cycle top. Let me know if you’d like more details or tools to explore these indicators further!

Realized Profit Short-Term Holder (STH) 


8. Reserve Risk Indicator

[HOW TO READ IT]

The Reserve Risk indicator evaluates the balance between the incentive to sell and the conviction of long-term Bitcoin holders. Here's how to interpret it for identifying market cycle tops:

High Reserve Risk (Above 0.0200):

Indicates overvaluation, as long-term holders are increasingly incentivized to sell due to high prices.
Historically aligns with market cycle tops, where the risk/reward becomes unfavorable and a correction is likely【312】【313】【314】.
Low Reserve Risk (Below 0.0026):

Suggests undervaluation, with strong conviction from long-term holders to hold their assets.
Often corresponds to bear market bottoms or the early phases of a bull market【311】【313】【314】.
Prolonged Periods at Extremes:

High levels tend to be short-lived, coinciding with rapid price increases.
Low levels may persist for extended periods, signaling accumulation phases before major upward trends【312】【313】.
You can track the Reserve Risk indicator on platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant for real-time data and historical insights. Let me know if you'd like further assistance!


9. RHODL Indicator

[HOW TO READ]

The RHODL Ratio is a market indicator that helps identify Bitcoin cycle tops by comparing the realized value of coins held in short-term (1-week) versus long-term (1-2 years) bands. Here’s how to read it:

High RHODL Ratio (Above Red Band)

When the RHODL Ratio enters or exceeds the "red band," it signals an overheated market. Historically, this aligns with major cycle tops as short-term holders dominate supply, and long-term holders reduce their positions.
Low RHODL Ratio (Below Red Band)

Indicates an undervalued market, often observed during accumulation phases or at the start of bull markets.
This indicator is particularly valuable because it accounts for Bitcoin's growing supply and the aging of its market, making it highly reliable for long-term trend analysis. You can track it on platforms like Bitcoin Top Indicator or Thuan Capital Analytics【320】【322】【323】.


10. STH MVRV Indicator

[HOW TO READ]

The STH MVRV (Short-Term Holder Market-Value-to-Realized-Value) indicator is used to measure whether Bitcoin's price is overvalued or undervalued, specifically from the perspective of short-term holders (those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days). Here’s how to read it to assess if the crypto cycle has topped:

STH MVRV Above 1:

When the STH MVRV ratio is greater than 1, it indicates that short-term holders are realizing profits, as the market value is higher than the price at which they bought the Bitcoin.
This is a potential warning sign of overvaluation and suggests the market might be reaching a top.
Sustained High STH MVRV:

If the indicator stays above 1 for a prolonged period, it implies ongoing profit-taking, which typically happens during euphoric phases of a bull market.
A sustained high reading can indicate the market may be nearing its peak.
Sharp Drop in STH MVRV:

A sharp decline in the STH MVRV after a prolonged high indicates that short-term holders are exiting the market, often signaling the top of the cycle and the beginning of a correction.
To track this indicator, platforms like CryptoQuant and Glassnode provide real-time data and insights on STH MVRV trends​

Let me know if you'd like more details or help with further analysis!


11. STH RP Indicator (STH Realized Price)

[HOW TO READ]

The Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH RP) is an important indicator to help identify when the market cycle might be reaching its top. This indicator measures the average price at which short-term holders (those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days) have acquired their Bitcoin. Here's how you should read it:

STH RP vs. Current Price:

When Bitcoin's current price rises above the STH RP, it indicates that short-term holders are in profit, creating potential resistance as these holders might begin to sell, particularly when the market becomes overheated.
When the price drops below the STH RP, it implies that short-term holders are at a loss, which can lead to increased selling pressure, but it also suggests market support as the price might find a base at or near this level​

12. STH SOPR 

[HOW TO READ]

The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) is an indicator that helps determine market sentiment and potential tops based on the behavior of short-term Bitcoin holders (holding coins for less than 155 days). Here's how to read it:

STH SOPR > 1:

When the STH SOPR is above 1, it indicates that short-term holders are selling at a profit. Persistently high values suggest profit-taking behavior, which often precedes market tops, especially during a bullish rally【351】【352】.

STH SOPR < 1:

A value below 1 means that short-term holders are selling at a loss. This is typical in bearish phases or corrections and indicates weak hands exiting the market【353】【354】.


Sharp Spikes in STH SOPR:

A sudden increase in the STH SOPR during an uptrend can signal an overheated market as more participants take profits. This can serve as a warning that the market is approaching a top【355】【354】.
Platforms like CryptoQuant and Glassnode provide real-time STH SOPR metrics to monitor these trends. Let me know if you'd like further help analyzing or interpreting the data!

13.Thermo Cap Indicator

[HOW TO READ]

The Thermo Cap indicator measures the total cumulative income earned by Bitcoin miners, including block rewards and transaction fees. Here's how you can read it to identify if the crypto market cycle is reaching a top:

High Market Cap to Thermo Cap Ratio

A high ratio indicates that Bitcoin’s market valuation significantly exceeds the total revenue earned by miners.
Historically, this level correlates with overvaluation and market cycle tops. For example, a ratio exceeding 0.000004 is considered a warning sign of over-speculation.
Low Market Cap to Thermo Cap Ratio

A low ratio suggests that Bitcoin may be undervalued relative to its mining cost. This level is often observed during accumulation phases or market bottoms.
Normalization for Long-Term Trends

Tools like logarithmic scaling or moving averages of Thermo Cap help identify sustained trends and remove noise from short-term fluctuations.
You can track the Thermo Cap and its ratios on platforms like CryptoQuant or TradingView, which provide real-time and historical data【362】【365】. Monitoring this indicator in conjunction with others like the MVRV Z-Score or SOPR can offer a clearer picture of the market cycle phase.


14. True Market Mean

[HOW TO READ]

The True Market Mean Price (TMMP) is a nuanced indicator that offers insights into market sentiment and activity by focusing on actively traded Bitcoin rather than the total market or dormant coins. Here’s how you can read it to understand whether the crypto market is approaching a cycle top:

Price Above True Market Mean:

If Bitcoin's market price is significantly higher than the True Market Mean, it suggests speculative exuberance. Prolonged periods in this state often align with overvaluation and signal potential market tops.
Price Near or Below True Market Mean:

When Bitcoin's price is close to or below the True Market Mean, it may indicate consolidation or undervaluation, common during accumulation phases or at cycle bottoms.
Divergence Between Realized and True Market Mean Prices:

A widening gap between these metrics, with market prices significantly exceeding both, often points to increased speculative activity and potential overheated market conditions【371】【372】【375】.
You can track the True Market Mean Price on platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant, which provide detailed analytics and real-time updates. Let me know if you need further assistance analyzing or interpreting these metrics!


15. CDD 90DMA

[HOW TO READ]

The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) 90-Day Moving Average (90DMA) indicator helps to gauge market cycles by analyzing the behavior of long-term holders through the movement of dormant coins. Here's how to interpret it to identify market tops:

Sharp Increase in CDD 90DMA:

A sudden spike in the CDD 90DMA often indicates that long-term holders (commonly referred to as "smart money") are selling their holdings. This behavior is typically observed during market euphoria and aligns with cycle tops【382】【383】.
Sustained High CDD 90DMA:

If the CDD remains elevated for an extended period, it suggests ongoing distribution by long-term holders, further signaling that the market is overheated and a correction might be imminent【384】.
Low or Declining CDD 90DMA:

A low or decreasing CDD indicates accumulation phases or market bottoms, as long-term holders are not actively selling their holdings.
You can monitor this indicator using platforms like CryptoQuant or CoinGecko, which provide detailed charts and insights for the CDD and its moving averages. Let me know if you’d like further clarification or assistance!


16. ETF BTC FLOW INDICATOR

[HOW TO READ]

The ETF BTC Flow indicator analyzes capital inflows and outflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering insights into institutional investor behavior. Here's how to interpret it for determining market cycle tops:

Large Inflows to Bitcoin ETFs:

Significant inflows often reflect strong institutional interest, which can drive prices higher. However, extremely high and sudden inflows may coincide with the late-stage euphoria of a market cycle.
Large Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs:

Major outflows suggest profit-taking by institutions, potentially signaling the start of a market downturn or correction. This is especially relevant when outflows follow a period of high inflows.
Sustained High Flows:

Continuous high inflows or outflows over time can provide insights into long-term sentiment shifts, either bullish or bearish.
For real-time tracking and analysis, platforms like CryptoQuant and TradingView provide detailed ETF BTC flow charts. Additionally, The Block and Bitbo.io offer ETF-specific insights, including net daily flow metrics【390】【392】【393】【394】.

17. HODL WAVES

[HOW TO READ]

The HODL Waves indicator visualizes the distribution of Bitcoin based on the age since coins last moved. It offers insights into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders, helping to identify potential market cycle tops. Here's how to interpret it:

Short-Term Activity Spikes (Warm Colors):

When the percentage of Bitcoin transacted within short time frames (e.g., 1 day to 1 week, or 1 month) spikes significantly (e.g., above 15–20%), it often signals speculative activity and potential market tops.
Such patterns were observed during the 2013, 2017, and 2021 tops【400】【401】.
Decline in Long-Term Holder Bands (Cool Colors):

A decrease in long-term holder activity (e.g., 1–5 years or 5+ years bands) suggests that long-term investors are selling, often coinciding with cycle tops as the supply shifts to short-term holders【401】【403】.
Current Insights:

If short-term holder bands remain subdued and long-term holder bands stay stable or increase, it suggests the market may not yet have reached a top and could still see further upward movement.
For real-time tracking, platforms like Glassnode and LookIntoBitcoin offer detailed HODL Waves charts. Let me know if you'd like additional guidance on using these tools!

18. Investor Cap Indicator

[HOW TO READ]

The Investor Cap indicator evaluates the capitalization of Bitcoin held by long-term investors, providing insights into their behavior during different market phases. Here’s how to read it to assess whether the crypto market cycle is approaching a top:

High Investor Cap Relative to Market Cap:

When the Investor Cap is significantly high compared to the Market Cap, it indicates that long-term holders have retained a strong share of the supply.
This is usually seen during accumulation phases or early stages of a bull market.
Declining Investor Cap During Price Rallies:

A drop in the Investor Cap as the price rises suggests that long-term holders are selling to take profits.
Sharp declines in the Investor Cap often align with market tops, where long-term holders distribute their holdings to new market participants.
Flat or Increasing Investor Cap in a Rally:

If the Investor Cap remains steady or increases during a price rally, it suggests confidence among long-term holders, often signaling that the market has more room to grow.
You can track Investor Cap metrics on platforms like Glassnode or CryptoQuant, where it is often presented alongside other indicators like Realized Cap or MVRV. This helps provide a clearer understanding of holder behavior and market conditions. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!


19. LTH MVRV

[HOW TO READ]

The LTH MVRV (Long-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value) indicator measures the profitability of Bitcoin held by long-term holders (those holding BTC for over 155 days). Here’s how to read it to assess whether the crypto market cycle is reaching a top:

LTH MVRV > 3.5:

Indicates that long-term holders are significantly in profit.
Historically, levels above 3.5 often align with market cycle tops, as long-term holders tend to realize profits at these levels, increasing sell pressure.

LTH MVRV Between 1 and 3.5:

Suggests moderate profitability for long-term holders.
This range typically reflects a healthy bull market phase with potential for further growth.

LTH MVRV < 1:

Indicates that long-term holders are at a loss.
This scenario is typical of market bottoms, signaling undervaluation and potential accumulation phases.
Rapid Declines After High LTH MVRV:

A sharp drop in LTH MVRV from elevated levels suggests increased selling by long-term holders, which often coincides with a market correction or the end of a bullish cycle.
Platforms for Tracking LTH MVRV:
You can monitor this indicator on platforms like Glassnode or CryptoQuant, which provide real-time and historical data on LTH profitability. Let me know if you need additional insights or help analyzing this data alongside other indicators!


20. LTH SOPR

[HOW TO READ]

The Long-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH SOPR) indicator measures whether long-term Bitcoin holders (holding for over 155 days) are selling at a profit or loss. Here's how to interpret it to determine if the crypto market cycle is nearing a top:

LTH SOPR > 1:

Indicates that long-term holders are selling at a profit.
Sustained high values during a bull market suggest profit-taking, which can signal that a market top is approaching, especially if accompanied by other overheated metrics.
LTH SOPR = 1:

Reflects that long-term holders are breaking even on their sales.
This level can act as a psychological support or resistance point during trend reversals.

LTH SOPR < 1:

Indicates that long-term holders are selling at a loss.
Often occurs in bear markets or during periods of capitulation, signaling potential market bottoms.

Sharp Spikes in LTH SOPR:

Sudden, significant increases in LTH SOPR values often align with euphoria or overvaluation phases in the market, signaling potential tops.
A decline after such spikes could indicate the start of a correction.
Tracking Tools:
Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant offer real-time data on LTH SOPR, helping to contextualize the profitability behavior of long-term holders.

21. Miner Reserves

[HOW TO READ]

The Miner Reserves indicator is a metric that tracks the amount of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency held by miners in their wallets. It provides insights into the behavior of miners, who typically sell or hold their mined coins depending on their market outlook.

Here’s how you can use Miner Reserves to analyze whether the crypto cycle has reached the top or if there’s still room for upside:

1. Understanding the Context of Miner Reserves
When miners accumulate: If miners are increasing their reserves (holding onto their coins), it can indicate that they expect the price to rise further. Miners are more likely to hold coins when they anticipate higher future prices.
When miners sell: If miners are selling their coins and reducing their reserves, it could suggest they believe the market is nearing a peak or that they want to take profits before prices fall.
2. Interpreting Miner Behavior
Rising Miner Reserves (during an uptrend): If the miner reserves are increasing during a period of price appreciation, it can be a sign of bullish sentiment. Miners are often seen as "smart money" because they have significant operational costs and are incentivized to sell when prices are favorable.
Declining Miner Reserves (during an uptrend): A decline in miner reserves could signal that miners are selling their coins. If this happens during an uptrend, it might suggest that miners are taking profits, and the market could be reaching its top or experiencing a shift towards a bearish trend.
3. Analyzing Miner Reserves with Price Action
Miner Reserves versus Price Divergence: If the price continues to rise while miner reserves are decreasing, it could indicate that the market is getting overheated. This may suggest that the price could be nearing a top.
Miner Reserves and Sharp Price Drops: A sudden drop in miner reserves often happens just before or during a major market correction. If miners are offloading coins in large quantities, it might signal a possible market peak or a coming pullback.
4. Historical Analysis and Market Cycles
Previous market tops: Historically, miner reserves tend to decrease or stabilize near market tops. Miners may offload coins during bullish market periods to lock in profits. By comparing current miner reserve behavior to past cycles, you can get a sense of whether the current trend is following a similar pattern.
Market sentiment: The behavior of miner reserves is often a lagging indicator, as miners react to market conditions rather than predicting them. However, if miner reserves are growing despite rising prices, it suggests continued confidence, and there may be more upside potential.
5. Key Signals to Look for
Miner reserves increasing with stable or increasing prices = Confidence, possible more upside.
Miner reserves decreasing while prices rise = Potential market top approaching, but not always a definitive signal.
Miner reserves sharply decreasing = Likely market topping, or the beginning of a downtrend.
6. Combining with Other Indicators
While miner reserves can provide useful insights, it’s important to combine this indicator with other market signals, such as:

On-chain data (like exchange inflows/outflows)
Market sentiment indicators
Technical analysis patterns (e.g., RSI, MACD)
Volume analysis
Summary:
If miners are accumulating coins (increasing reserves), this is typically a bullish sign, suggesting there may still be room for upside.
If miners are selling or decreasing their reserves, it might indicate that they expect the market to top soon, and further price increases could be limited.
It’s important to consider Miner Reserves in the context of overall market behavior and combine it with other indicators to get a clearer picture of the market cycle.

22. MVOCDD Indicator

[HOW TO READ]

The MVOCDD (Market Value to Realized Value on Chain Divergence) indicator is an on-chain metric that helps gauge market sentiment by comparing the current market value of an asset (like Bitcoin) with its realized value. This comparison provides insights into whether the market is in an overbought or oversold condition and can help assess whether the market has reached a top or if there is still potential for further upside.

Understanding the MVOCDD Indicator
Market Value (MV): This refers to the current price of an asset multiplied by its circulating supply. It’s essentially the "market cap" based on the live market price.

Realized Value (RV): This is the sum of the value of each coin at the price it was last moved. It provides a sense of the "realized market cap," or how much the market participants paid for their coins. In other words, it reflects the amount of capital that has been spent on Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency).

MVOCDD: The MVOCDD compares the Market Value (MV) and the Realized Value (RV) to track divergences between the two, which can give insights into potential market tops or bottoms.

How to Read the MVOCDD Indicator
Interpreting the Divergence between MV and RV

MVOCDD = Market Value / Realized Value.
When MVOCDD is high, it indicates that the current market price is far higher than the "realized value," meaning the market is highly speculative, and a large portion of the market has purchased at prices much lower than the current price.
When MVOCDD is low, it means the market price is closer to or below the realized value, indicating that market participants have spent more capital on coins in the past, and the market might be undervalued or in a more neutral state.
Key Levels to Watch

MVOCDD above 1.0: When MVOCDD is greater than 1, this indicates that the market value is higher than the realized value, signaling that market participants are in profit. A very high MVOCDD (significantly greater than 1) could indicate that the market is overheated and a top is approaching, as speculative buying is driving the price up.
MVOCDD near or below 1.0: If the MVOCDD is close to 1, it suggests that the market is more balanced, and there is not much divergence between the market value and the price at which people bought their coins. A lower MVOCDD indicates a more stable or undervalued market.
MVOCDD below 0.9: If the MVOCDD drops below 1 and stays lower (e.g., closer to 0.8 or 0.9), it could be a sign of market weakness, where the market value is much lower than the realized value, and the market might be undervalued or near a bottom.
Watching for Major Divergences

Divergence between MVOCDD and Price: One of the most powerful signals is when there is a divergence between the MVOCDD and price action. If MVOCDD is rising while prices are also increasing, it suggests that the market is growing based on solid market participation (healthy growth).
Bullish Divergence (Price rising, MVOCDD decreasing): A bearish signal occurs when the price is still rising, but MVOCDD is either flat or declining. This could suggest that while the price is going up, fewer participants are "in the money" (i.e., coins are being bought at higher prices), indicating a possible overextension of the market.
Bearish Divergence (Price dropping, MVOCDD rising): If the price is decreasing while MVOCDD is increasing, this suggests that the market is becoming more undervalued, which may indicate a bottom or potential recovery.
Using MVOCDD to Identify Market Tops

A high MVOCDD during a price rally typically indicates that the market is entering a speculative phase. If this high level is sustained over time, it could signal that the market is overheated and nearing a top, as more people are buying in at prices much higher than the realized value.
When MVOCDD begins to decline after a period of increasing, it could signal the start of a market correction, as the market moves back toward a more reasonable price level.
Combining MVOCDD with Other Indicators While MVOCDD can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and help identify market tops and bottoms, it is most effective when used in conjunction with other on-chain and technical analysis indicators:

Price Action: Look at the broader market structure, such as support and resistance levels.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): A high RSI could further confirm that the market is overbought.
MACD: A bearish divergence between the price and the MVOCDD might coincide with negative MACD crossovers.
On-Chain Data: Metrics like miner reserves, exchange flows, and realized profit/loss can also provide further context to MVOCDD readings.
Summary of How to Use MVOCDD to Assess the Market Cycle:
Rising MVOCDD (Above 1): Indicates the market is likely overheated and could be nearing a top.
Falling MVOCDD (Below 1): Suggests the market is cooling off or becoming undervalued, with potential for more upside if the price continues rising.
Divergence between MVOCDD and Price: If MVOCDD is diverging negatively (e.g., falling while prices rise), it could signal that the market is overextending and approaching a peak.
Combining with Other Indicators: Always cross-check MVOCDD with other tools and metrics (like RSI, volume, and price patterns) for a clearer view of the market cycle.
By tracking the MVOCDD, you can gain valuable insights into the sentiment and market structure, helping you assess whether the current trend has more upside potential or is approaching a peak.


23. NRPL BTC

[HOW TO READ]

The NRPL (Net Realized Profit/Loss) BTC Indicator is an important on-chain metric that measures the realized profits and losses of Bitcoin holders, providing insights into market sentiment and whether the market has reached a top or if there’s still room for upside.
Understanding the NRPL BTC Indicator
Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) measures the difference between realized profits and realized losses. Realized profits and losses are calculated based on the prices at which coins were last moved or spent.
Realized Profit: Occurs when coins are sold or spent at a higher price than they were acquired.
Realized Loss: Occurs when coins are sold or spent at a lower price than they were acquired.
The NRPL BTC Indicator calculates the net balance of realized profits and losses, with the overall idea being:
Positive NRPL: More realized profits than losses, suggesting market participants are in profit and potentially more inclined to sell (especially in a bullish market).
Negative NRPL: More realized losses than profits, indicating a market under stress or in a correction phase.
How to Read the NRPL BTC Indicator to Assess the Market Cycle
General Insights from NRPL BTC
Positive NRPL: When the NRPL is positive, it indicates that more market participants are realizing profits than losses. This is typically a bullish signal, as it suggests that many traders and investors are in the money. A strong positive NRPL during a bull market may indicate that the market is overheated, and participants could start taking profits, which may lead to a correction or a top formation.
Negative NRPL: If the NRPL is negative, it means more participants are realizing losses, indicating a bearish market sentiment. This is often seen in bear markets or corrections, where many investors who bought during higher price levels are now selling at a loss.
Watching for Key Thresholds
Large Positive NRPL: A sharp increase in positive NRPL (especially during a bull run) could signal market euphoria. It suggests that many people are in profit and might start selling their holdings, which could lead to increased selling pressure. This is typically a sign of market topping behavior or overextension.
Example: During a bull market, if NRPL spikes dramatically (for example, if it reaches an extreme value, much higher than historical levels), it could signal that the market is due for a correction, as profit-taking will likely increase.
Moderate Positive NRPL: A moderate or gradual increase in NRPL, where profits are being realized but not excessively, might suggest that there is still room for the price to grow. Traders are realizing profits but might not be aggressively selling, indicating continued optimism.
Zero or Near Zero NRPL: When NRPL is close to zero, it indicates a balance between realized profits and losses, which typically occurs when the market is in a consolidation phase. This suggests uncertainty and may indicate that there is still room for upside if price action begins to favor the bulls.
Large Negative NRPL: When the NRPL is negative, it shows that a significant amount of loss is being realized. This typically signals a bear market or correction and suggests that the market could have further downside. In contrast, during a correction or bear market, if the NRPL starts to turn positive again, it could signal that the market is stabilizing and ready for a reversal.
Key Patterns to Watch for
Rising NRPL During Price Rallies: If the price of Bitcoin is increasing and NRPL is also rising, it suggests that market participants are realizing profits, and this can be a sign that the market is nearing the top.
Decreasing NRPL During Price Rallies: If NRPL is declining while the price is rising, it suggests that fewer people are realizing profits (and possibly fewer are in profit). This can signal that the market has room for further upside, as the selling pressure is not increasing.
Divergence with Price Action: If the NRPL is rising significantly while prices are also climbing, it could indicate exuberant market behavior or that participants are taking profits too early, potentially signaling a near top. Conversely, if NRPL is rising while prices are stagnating or falling, this could indicate a market bottom is forming, as people are realizing losses.
Using NRPL in Context with Market Phases
Bull Market Top: In the later stages of a bull market, you often see high NRPL readings, which can indicate that many holders are sitting on large profits. As more people take profits, it might trigger a price reversal. This is often followed by an increase in selling pressure and a market correction.
Bear Market Bottom: During a bear market, the NRPL may remain negative for extended periods as many investors are in losses. However, when NRPL turns positive, it could signal a shift in sentiment, indicating that the market is beginning to recover.
Market Reversal: A sudden shift in NRPL from negative to positive (or vice versa) often coincides with a market reversal. This shift could either mark the end of a bear market or the start of a correction in a bull market.
Combining NRPL with Other Indicators To improve the reliability of your analysis, you should combine the NRPL BTC indicator with other metrics such as:
On-chain metrics like Miner Reserves, Exchange Flows, and Active Addresses.
Technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, support and resistance levels) to confirm potential market tops or bottoms.
Price volume analysis to observe whether selling pressure is rising as prices increase or decline.
Summary of How to Use NRPL BTC to Assess the Market Cycle:
Rising NRPL (strong positive): Indicates many participants are realizing profits, suggesting the market could be overheated and potentially near a top. If this is coupled with price rallies, it could signal a top.
Falling or neutral NRPL: Suggests more stability or less profit-taking, indicating there could still be upside potential in the market.
Large Negative NRPL: Indicates bearish sentiment, with losses being realized, signaling market weakness or potential for a deeper correction.
Zero or close to zero NRPL: A balanced market with little realized profit/loss, which could indicate consolidation or accumulation before a breakout.
By interpreting NRPL BTC in combination with other indicators, you can gain a better understanding of whether the market has reached its top or if there is still room for further upside.
24. Realized Profit STH Indicator

[HOW TO READ]


The Realized Profit STH (Short-Term Holders) indicator is an important on-chain metric used to assess the behavior of short-term holders (STH) in the market. It measures the realized profits of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency that has been held for less than 155 days (roughly 5 months), which typically corresponds to newer market participants or traders who have recently bought in.

This indicator provides insights into whether short-term holders are in profit, and it can be used to help define whether the market cycle is reaching a top or if there is still potential for further upside. Here's how you can read and interpret the Realized Profit STH indicator to assess the market cycle:

Understanding the Realized Profit STH Indicator
Realized Profit STH: This metric looks at the realized profits of short-term holders — those who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Realized profits refer to the difference between the price at which coins were bought and the price at which they were sold or moved.
Realized profit is calculated by taking the difference between the price of the asset when it was acquired and when it was last moved (transacted), and summing up those profits across all coins in the market.
Short-term holders: These are investors who have recently bought Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and have held it for a relatively short period of time. Typically, STH behavior can be more speculative and reactive to price movements.
How to Read the Realized Profit STH Indicator
Positive Realized Profit for Short-Term Holders

When the Realized Profit STH is high: This indicates that a significant portion of short-term holders are realizing profits. This often happens during strong price rallies or bull markets.
What it signals: A rising Realized Profit STH is usually a sign that short-term traders or newer market participants are profiting from recent price increases. While this may seem bullish, it can also signal that the market is becoming overheated, as traders often take profits after a strong rally.
Caution: A large increase in the Realized Profit STH during a rally could signal that many market participants are taking profits, which could result in selling pressure. This can be an early warning sign that the market is nearing a top or may be due for a correction. Essentially, when many short-term holders take profits, it may create a selling environment.
Realized Profit STH Increasing During a Bull Market

If the Realized Profit STH indicator is rising steadily during a bull market, it means short-term holders are continuously locking in profits. While this can be a bullish signal in the short term, it often indicates market exhaustion:
What to look for: A rapid rise in the indicator (especially when the price is still increasing) could indicate that the market is overheating, and that the buying momentum might start to slow down.
Potential top signal: If Realized Profit STH reaches extreme levels (i.e., it increases significantly higher than previous market cycles), this is often a sign of speculative excess and a potential market top. Short-term holders might be exiting the market, leaving behind long-term holders, which can lead to a price reversal or a market correction.
Flat or Decreasing Realized Profit STH

When the Realized Profit STH is flat or decreasing, it suggests that short-term holders are not in profit, or they are holding their positions and not realizing profits.
What it signals: This could imply underconfidence or that market participants are holding their positions, indicating that there may be less short-term selling pressure. It could be a neutral or bullish signal, as it means people are still holding and waiting for higher prices.
If the Realized Profit STH is low during a price rally, it suggests that there is less profit-taking and that market participants (especially short-term holders) believe that the price has further room to rise before they exit. In this case, there could be more upside potential before a top is reached.
Sharp Decrease or Negative Realized Profit STH

If the Realized Profit STH drops sharply or turns negative (i.e., more short-term holders are realizing losses), it indicates that the short-term holders who bought at higher prices are now selling at a loss. This could be a sign of a market correction or that bearish sentiment is starting to set in.
What to look for: A sharp negative Realized Profit STH during a period of price decline could indicate that short-term holders are being forced to sell, which might further contribute to the downturn.
Bearish signal: If this occurs during a correction or a bear market, it can signal that market sentiment is shifting and that further downside is possible.
Comparing Realized Profit STH with Market Price

Realized Profit STH vs. Price Action: If Realized Profit STH is rising alongside price in a bullish market, it often indicates that more short-term participants are profiting from the rally, but this could signal overextension and a possible reversal when profit-taking intensifies.
Divergence between price and Realized Profit STH: If price continues to rise but Realized Profit STH decreases, it could indicate that fewer short-term holders are profiting, which could be a bearish sign, suggesting that market growth is slowing and a top could be approaching.
Key Signals to Look For
Rising Realized Profit STH with strong price rallies: While this can be a positive sign in the short term, it could indicate that market sentiment is overheated. If Realized Profit STH spikes dramatically, it could signal that a top is near, as short-term holders may start selling.
Flat or decreasing Realized Profit STH: A more neutral or bullish signal, suggesting that short-term holders are not taking profits and may still be expecting higher prices.
Sharp increase in Realized Profit STH after a significant rally: This can be a sign of market exhaustion, and a top may be near, as short-term holders are locking in profits.
Summary of How to Use Realized Profit STH to Define Market Top or Upside Potential:
Increasing Realized Profit STH during a price rally = Potential market top or overextension; consider market exhaustion.
Flat or decreasing Realized Profit STH = Indicates room for further upside; fewer short-term holders are taking profits, which may signal continued optimism.
Sharp drop or negative Realized Profit STH = Indicates losses are being realized, signaling potential for a market correction or top.
Divergence with Price: If price continues to rise but Realized Profit STH falls, it can signal that the market is losing momentum and may be nearing its peak.
By tracking the Realized Profit STH indicator alongside price action and other on-chain metrics, you can gain insights into whether the crypto market has reached a top or whether there’s still room for further price increases.


25. CMC 100 INDEX

[HOW TO READ]

The CMC 100 Index (CoinMarketCap Top 100 Index) tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, providing a comprehensive view of the overall crypto market’s health and sentiment. This index helps gauge the market cycle, and interpreting its trends can provide insights into whether the cycle has reached a top or if there is room for further upside.
Here’s how you can read the CMC 100 Index to evaluate the crypto cycle:

1. Identifying Bull and Bear Market Phases
Bull Market Trend: A steadily rising CMC 100 Index indicates growing market capitalization among the top cryptocurrencies. During a bull market:
Accelerated growth often occurs as more capital flows into the market.
A parabolic rise in the index may signal market euphoria and the potential for a cycle top. Historically, such parabolic moves are unsustainable and followed by corrections.
Bear Market Trend: A declining index signals reduced interest and capital outflows from the market. If the index is falling sharply, it may indicate that the market has entered a bear phase.

2. Key Signals to Detect Market Tops
Overextended Growth:
A sharp increase in the CMC 100 Index, particularly over a short period, can signal market overextension or euphoria.
Compare the current rate of increase to historical peaks in previous cycles. If the index shows signs of reaching or exceeding these levels, it may indicate that the cycle is nearing its top.
Watch for a flattening or slowing in the rate of increase, which often precedes a reversal.
Market Sentiment and Divergences:
If the CMC 100 Index continues rising, but other metrics, like trading volumes or on-chain data, suggest decreasing activity, it could indicate a divergence—a potential sign of reduced confidence in sustained growth.
A divergence between the index and leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (e.g., Bitcoin dominance increases as altcoins underperform) might also indicate a market nearing its top.

3. Assessing Room for Upside
Gradual, Consistent Growth:
A steady, moderate increase in the index suggests sustainable growth in the market and likely room for further upside.
If the index is climbing without showing signs of overheating (parabolic rises or sharp volume increases), it could mean the market is still in an accumulation or early bullish phase.
Corrections During Uptrends:
Periodic corrections in the index during an uptrend are healthy and indicate that the market may still have room for upside.
Sharp corrections followed by quick recoveries often signal strong market confidence and continued bullish potential.

4. Comparing CMC 100 Index with Historical Peaks
Examine the levels reached in previous market tops to identify whether the index is approaching comparable levels. For example:
If the CMC 100 Index is close to its historical all-time high, it may indicate that the market is nearing the end of the cycle.
However, breaking past historical highs with strong momentum and volume suggests that the market could still have room for growth in a supercycle scenario.

5. Monitoring Index Composition
Analyze shifts in the composition of the index. For example:
If the index becomes heavily weighted toward speculative assets or new altcoins with rapid, unsustainable growth, it may signal speculative euphoria and a potential market top.
If the index remains dominated by established projects with strong fundamentals (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), it suggests more resilience and room for further upside.

6. Combining with Other Indicators
To confirm signals from the CMC 100 Index, consider combining it with the following:
Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D):
Rising BTC dominance alongside a flattening or declining CMC 100 Index often indicates a shift from riskier altcoins to Bitcoin, signaling reduced risk appetite and potentially marking a market top.
Declining BTC dominance with a rising index may signal strong altcoin performance, suggesting room for upside in the overall market.
Total Market Cap and Altcoin Market Cap:
Compare the trends in the CMC 100 Index to the broader total market cap. Disparities in performance may highlight sector-specific dynamics or indicate early signs of a top.
On-Chain Metrics:
Metrics like realized profits, active addresses, or network growth can validate whether the market is overextended or still growing sustainably.
Volume and Sentiment:
High trading volumes paired with strong index growth are typically bullish. However, low volume with rising prices might signal waning interest, often a precursor to a top.

Summary of How to Use the CMC 100 Index to Assess Market Cycles
Signals of a Market Top:
Parabolic or unsustainable growth in the index.
The index reaching or exceeding historical highs.
Divergences with volume, Bitcoin dominance, or other metrics.
Speculative altcoin dominance within the index.
Signals of Further Upside:
Steady and gradual growth in the index.
Periodic corrections that recover quickly.
Strong volume and fundamentals driving index increases.
New highs backed by solid market sentiment and participation.
By regularly monitoring the CMC 100 Index and combining it with other market indicators, you can make more informed assessments of whether the crypto cycle is nearing its top or if there is room for additional growth.
26. RSI Indicator

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.
Here’s how you can calculate RSI for Bitcoin or any other asset:

1. Collect Price Data
Obtain historical price data for Bitcoin, such as the closing prices over a specific period. This data can be fetched from cryptocurrency APIs like Binance, Coinbase, or CryptoCompare.

2. Choose a Lookback Period
The standard period for RSI calculation is 14 periods (e.g., 14 days, 14 hours, or 14 minutes, depending on your timeframe).

3. Calculate RSI
The RSI is calculated using the following formula:
RSI=100−(1001+RS)RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)RSI=100−(1+RS100​)
Where:
RS=Average GainAverage LossRS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}RS=Average LossAverage Gain​
Steps:
Compute the price change for each period: ΔPrice=Current Price−Previous Price\Delta \text{Price} = \text{Current Price} - \text{Previous Price}ΔPrice=Current Price−Previous Price
Separate the gains and losses:
Gains: Positive price changes.
Losses: Absolute values of negative price changes.
Compute the Average Gain and Average Loss:
For the first 14 periods: Average Gain=Sum of Gains over 14 periods14\text{Average Gain} = \frac{\text{Sum of Gains over 14 periods}}{14}Average Gain=14Sum of Gains over 14 periods​ Average Loss=Sum of Losses over 14 periods14\text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Sum of Losses over 14 periods}}{14}Average Loss=14Sum of Losses over 14 periods​
For subsequent periods, use a smoothing formula: Average Gain (new)=(Previous Average Gain×13)+Current Gain14\text{Average Gain (new)} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average Gain} \times 13) + \text{Current Gain}}{14}Average Gain (new)=14(Previous Average Gain×13)+Current Gain​ Average Loss (new)=(Previous Average Loss×13)+Current Loss14\text{Average Loss (new)} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average Loss} \times 13) + \text{Current Loss}}{14}Average Loss (new)=14(Previous Average Loss×13)+Current Loss​
Compute the RS: RS=Average GainAverage LossRS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}RS=Average LossAverage Gain​
Compute the RSI: RSI=100−(1001+RS)RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)RSI=100−(1+RS100​)

4. Interpret RSI
RSI > 70: Overbought (potential sell signal).
RSI < 30: Oversold (potential buy signal).

RSI AGAIN WITH TYPESCRIPT


Here’s how you can calculate RSI for Bitcoin, followed by a TypeScript implementation.

How RSI is Calculated
Collect Data: Fetch historical Bitcoin closing prices. The RSI calculation requires at least 14 periods of data (commonly 14 days, hours, or minutes).
Calculate Price Changes:
Compute the difference between consecutive closing prices.
Separate the gains and losses (positive and negative differences).
Calculate Average Gains and Losses:
Use the simple average for the first 14 periods.
Use a smoothing formula for subsequent periods.
Calculate RS and RSI:
RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain / Average Loss.
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)).

Explanation of the Code
Initialization:
Start with the prices array and define the RSI period (default is 14).
First 14 Periods:
Compute gains and losses for the initial period.
Calculate the average gain and loss.
Subsequent Periods:
Apply the smoothing formula for gains and losses.
Compute RS and then RSI for each period.
Result:
The RSI array includes null for the first 14 periods where RSI cannot be calculated.

Interpreting the RSI
RSI > 70: The asset is overbought and may be due for a correction.
RSI < 30: The asset is oversold and may experience upward momentum.
27. NUPL
Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit Loss. It represents investor sentiment and shows what Bitcoin holders would gain or lose if they sold now.
Understanding NUPL
Formula:
NUPL=Market Cap−Realized CapMarket Cap\text{NUPL} = \frac{\text{Market Cap} - \text{Realized Cap}}{\text{Market Cap}}NUPL=Market CapMarket Cap−Realized Cap​
Market Cap: Current total value of all coins in circulation (price * supply).
Realized Cap: Total value of all coins based on their price when they last moved on-chain.
Interpretation:
NUPL measures the ratio of net unrealized profit/loss in the market.
A higher NUPL value indicates more unrealized profits among holders, signaling optimism or euphoria.
A lower NUPL value indicates more unrealized losses, signaling pessimism or fear.

NUPL Levels and Market States
NUPL is typically divided into different zones, which correspond to market sentiment and possible price action:
Capitulation (NUPL < 0):
Unrealized losses exceed unrealized profits.
Often occurs during bear market bottoms.
Indicates potential buying opportunities.
Hope/Fear (0 < NUPL < 0.25):
Market begins to recover, but uncertainty remains.
Early signs of market recovery.
Optimism/Denial (0.25 < NUPL < 0.5):
Participants are in moderate profit, signaling optimism.
Denial may indicate disbelief about the end of a bull run.
Greed (0.5 < NUPL < 0.75):
Significant unrealized profits.
Signals growing market euphoria but not necessarily a top.
Euphoria (NUPL > 0.75):
Market participants are in extreme profit.
Historically aligns with bull market tops as euphoria peaks.

Using NUPL to Identify Market Tops
Look for Euphoria: When NUPL exceeds 0.75, it suggests that most participants are in significant profit, often leading to profit-taking and price corrections.
Historical Patterns: Analyze historical NUPL peaks during previous bull markets. For example:
Bitcoin's bull runs in 2013, 2017, and 2021 showed NUPL > 0.75 at or near market tops.
Watch for Declines: After reaching euphoria, a drop in NUPL could signal the beginning of a market correction or the start of a bear market.

Visualizing NUPL
You can use charts from on-chain analytics platforms like:
Glassnode: Offers detailed NUPL visualizations.
CryptoQuant or Santiment: Provide alternative on-chain data views.

Key Considerations
Complementary Indicators:
Use NUPL alongside other metrics like the MVRV Ratio, Bitcoin dominance, or technical indicators (RSI, MACD).
Analyze volume, macroeconomic trends, and market sentiment.
Lagging Nature:
NUPL is based on realized and unrealized profits, which can lag behind price action. Do not rely on it as the sole indicator for timing tops or bottoms.
Market Conditions:
Historical NUPL thresholds may change over time due to differences in market structure and participant behavior.

28. Puell Multiple 

[HOW TO READ]



The Puell Multiple is a powerful on-chain indicator used to assess whether the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, is in a potential top or bottom phase. It evaluates miner revenue and provides insights into the profitability of miners, which can indirectly signal market tops and bottoms.

Understanding the Puell Multiple
Formula:
Puell Multiple=Daily BTC Issuance (USD)365-Day Moving Average of Daily BTC Issuance (USD)\text{Puell Multiple} = \frac{\text{Daily BTC Issuance (USD)}}{\text{365-Day Moving Average of Daily BTC Issuance (USD)}}Puell Multiple=365-Day Moving Average of Daily BTC Issuance (USD)Daily BTC Issuance (USD)​
Daily BTC Issuance (USD): The total value of newly mined Bitcoin in USD on a given day.
365-Day Moving Average: A smoothed value representing the average daily issuance over the past year.
Purpose:
Measures how much miner revenue (in USD) deviates from its long-term trend.
High values indicate unusually high miner revenue, often correlated with market tops.
Low values indicate unusually low miner revenue, often correlated with market bottoms.

Key Levels and Market States
The Puell Multiple is divided into zones to interpret market conditions:
Undervalued (Below 0.5):
Miner revenue is significantly lower than the yearly average.
Often corresponds to bear market bottoms.
Indicates favorable accumulation opportunities.
Fair Value (0.5 - 4):
Miner revenue is within a normal range.
Typically occurs during market recoveries or consolidations.
Overheated (Above 4):
Miner revenue is significantly higher than the yearly average.
Often signals euphoria in the market and aligns with bull market tops.

Using the Puell Multiple to Identify Market Tops
Monitor the "Overheated Zone":
When the Puell Multiple exceeds 4, it indicates miners are making substantial profits due to high Bitcoin prices.
Historically, this level has coincided with market tops, as seen in:
2011: Puell Multiple reached ~10 during the bull run peak.
2013: Puell Multiple spiked above 8 during the dual bull market peaks.
2017: Puell Multiple exceeded 4 during the peak of Bitcoin's bull run.
Look for a Reversal:
A decline in the Puell Multiple after entering the "Overheated Zone" often signals the start of a correction or bear market.
Combine with Other Indicators:
Confirm signals using complementary metrics, such as:
Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum.
Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for market sentiment.
MVRV Ratio for valuation comparison.

Visualizing the Puell Multiple
Platforms like Glassnode, LookIntoBitcoin, and CryptoQuant provide real-time and historical Puell Multiple charts. These tools often highlight the zones of undervaluation and overheating.

Key Considerations
Dynamic Market Conditions:
Historical thresholds (e.g., 4 for overheating) may evolve due to changes in market dynamics, miner behavior, or adoption.
Not a Standalone Tool:
Use the Puell Multiple in conjunction with other indicators for a more comprehensive analysis.
Miner revenue spikes may also result from external factors like transaction fee surges during network congestion.
Time Lag:
The Puell Multiple reflects miner revenue, which can lag behind actual price action. Monitor for confirmation from price trends and volume.

Conclusion
The Puell Multiple is a reliable tool for identifying potential market tops when it enters the Overheated Zone (above 4). By tracking it, you can anticipate when Bitcoin's price might be approaching unsustainable levels and make informed decisions about taking profits or reducing exposure.
