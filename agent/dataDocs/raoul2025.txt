00:00:17.439 everyone I'm R pal and welcome to my
00:00:19.840 show the journeyman where we explore
00:00:22.920 that Nexus of macro crypto in the
00:00:25.199 exponential age of
00:00:26.960 Technology now it's getting towards
00:00:29.000 Christmas and the holiday season we're
00:00:31.080 all kind of getting our travel plans
00:00:33.200 sorted out thinking about spending time
00:00:35.320 with friends and family I thought I'd do
00:00:37.440 a little special for you um what I'm
00:00:39.520 going to do is release the video I did
00:00:41.840 for the real Vision Festival of learning
00:00:43.840 that was only on the real Vision
00:00:45.320 platform about my presentation of the
00:00:47.520 year ahead for crypto how the banana
00:00:49.520 Zone plays out I hopefully it'll be a
00:00:52.079 good Christmas present to you and give
00:00:54.000 you some idea how to navigate now it was
00:00:55.840 a few weeks old but I think it still
00:00:57.719 holds up very well today you know it's
00:01:00.480 been an extraordinary year we've
00:01:02.039 interviewed or I've managed to interview
00:01:03.719 some amazing people on the channel we've
00:01:06.240 explored everything from AI
00:01:07.960 Consciousness to crypto and everything
00:01:10.159 in the middle it's a real privilege to
00:01:12.880 be able to have these conversations and
00:01:14.360 share them with you and hopefully you're
00:01:16.640 seeing how all of these things fit
00:01:18.840 together crypto is just one of the parts
00:01:20.840 of the equation as is macro as is
00:01:22.840 technology we're all going towards this
00:01:25.400 economic Singularity where I think we've
00:01:27.960 got maybe five years before the entire
00:01:29.960 our system changes we got five years to
00:01:33.079 make as much money as possible so we can
00:01:35.600 protect ourselves and our families from
00:01:37.520 the massive change that lies ahead you
00:01:39.280 can already see it you know if we start
00:01:41.880 to see the AI have Consciousness and
00:01:43.920 crypto is being adopted by the White
00:01:45.439 House what happens next year what
00:01:47.079 happens when the robots come what
00:01:48.600 happens when we're going to Mars what
00:01:50.119 yeah there is so much that is happening
00:01:52.680 and so much will become complicated and
00:01:54.680 I'll be there for you on that journey to
00:01:57.159 navigate to make sense of it all and to
00:01:59.920 put you point you in the right direction
00:02:02.479 but anyway all I wanted to do is really
00:02:04.520 wish you a fantastic Christmas or

00:02:17.720 out there join me Ral pal as I go on a
00:02:21.239 journey of Discovery through the macro
00:02:23.519 cryto and exponential age landscapes in
00:02:26.840 the journey man I talked to the smartest
00:02:28.920 people in the world so we can all become
00:02:31.480 smarter
00:02:36.480 together welcome
00:02:38.599 everybody to the Festival of learning
00:02:41.319 Festival of learning the Banana's own
00:02:43.680 Edition Festival of learning something
00:02:45.280 that we've been doing since the pandemic
00:02:47.159 where we all get together and we have an
00:02:49.920 intense day of learning about topics
00:02:53.239 that are important to us the banana Zone
00:02:56.040 and crypto are the most important topics
00:02:58.480 of the moment and we we want to help you
00:03:00.680 in your journey of understanding so you
00:03:04.000 get to understand how better to navigate
00:03:07.319 this so I'm going to do a presentation
00:03:09.519 first then Jamie Coots who's our chief
00:03:12.120 crypto analyst um you see him mainly in
00:03:14.920 the Pro crypto tier um he will come on
00:03:17.799 do a presentation about the Nexus of AI
00:03:19.640 in crypto and then we've got lots of
00:03:21.560 people from mean coins to a great
00:03:24.000 presentation by suie and a really fun
00:03:26.959 panel with Club Dean sui and Club and
00:03:30.080 thank you guys are sponsors of the
00:03:31.879 Festival of learning um and you'll see
00:03:34.200 some great presentations from them both
00:03:36.519 Ultra interesting hi R here listen I
00:03:40.680 think we've got until 2030 before the
00:03:43.480 economic Singularity arrives now it
00:03:45.000 might not be the exact date but it's
00:03:46.760 around then so we have about six years
00:03:50.040 to figure out how to unfuck our future
00:03:52.959 I've put together a report to help you
00:03:54.760 called prepare for 2030 it's going to
00:03:57.040 help you take the first steps in that
00:03:59.200 Journey to make sure you're secure past
00:04:01.920 2030 so just click on the link below and
00:04:04.840 start your journey now um okay so let's
00:04:08.920 get on to riding the banana with ra
00:04:12.079 which is my session now which is a
00:04:13.959 ridiculous name but that's what I come
00:04:15.439 up with now I just want to just level
00:04:18.279 set with you the first thing I want you
00:04:20.720 to do is stop doing
00:04:24.600 this this is the five minutely chart of
00:04:28.199 Bitcoin and it's all
00:04:31.199 drama I want you to zoom out and get a
00:04:34.080 proper perspective stop the drama of
00:04:36.720 Twitter of oh my God it broke 100,000
00:04:38.560 it's falling below 100,000 it's Fallen
00:04:40.240 10,000 points and then it's going back
00:04:41.840 up again all of this is the wrong way to
00:04:44.880 trade crypto to capture that opportunity
00:04:47.840 to unfuck your future so I'm going to
00:04:50.600 show you the big picture so I'll stop
00:04:52.160 sharing this screen and flip you on to a
00:04:54.880 slideshow that I've put together for you
00:04:56.520 all um now what's important about this
00:04:59.919 is when I do these presentations this is
00:05:02.199 not real vision's views These are My
00:05:04.120 Views R pal and My Views the DNA of My
00:05:07.840 Views come from Global macro investor my
00:05:11.240 premium research service there not part
00:05:12.919 of real Vision people in real Vision get
00:05:15.639 access to that level of thinking in real
00:05:18.120 Vision Pro real Vision Pro is where I
00:05:21.080 outline it the real Vision members my
00:05:23.919 macro crypto exponential age of
00:05:26.560 Technology Nexus and that incredible
00:05:29.360 port portfolio which is one of the best
00:05:31.440 performing portfolios I've ever seen
00:05:34.240 luckily um also many of these are charts
00:05:38.240 also do appear in real Vision Plus as
00:05:40.039 part of the macro investing tool that
00:05:41.639 Julian Bell who works with me uh at GMI
00:05:46.000 he's the chief macro strategist there
00:05:49.520 his ideas and my ideas come into into
00:05:52.600 that MIT product as well but it's less
00:05:55.319 in depth doesn't give you the Nuance of
00:05:57.280 really what's behind it which is what
00:05:58.919 the pro is just so you understand so
00:06:01.120 anyway let's cut to the presentation so
00:06:04.160 I can run you through the banana Zone
00:06:06.960 where we are where we're
00:06:08.680 going
00:06:10.680 okay
00:06:13.120 so about well in September we started
00:06:16.680 producing this chart you already know
00:06:20.080 that I have identified that Global
00:06:23.639 liquidity is the driver of crypto assets
00:06:28.120 and for vast periods of time they
00:06:29.960 actually just mirror Global liquidity
00:06:32.599 when you get into the speculative
00:06:33.919 blowoff season it actually tends to
00:06:36.360 decouple to the upside because these are
00:06:38.919 exponential assets but right now we're
00:06:41.319 still in the point where they're highly
00:06:44.000 coupled so in September we showed this
00:06:46.199 chart and said the first leg of the
00:06:48.919 banana zone is
00:06:50.520 coming cut it
00:06:52.560 today I mean that's perfect I I
00:06:56.039 didn't expect that to work as well as
00:06:57.759 that I mean that is literally perfect
00:07:00.199 and that chart suggests that we go
00:07:03.440 somewhere close to 110,000 maybe we
00:07:05.720 overshoot it whatever it is but into the
00:07:08.879 end of the year before we correct so
00:07:12.039 this is the burst phase of the banana
00:07:13.960 zone so how is it looking in markets
00:07:16.360 themselves let's flip through some
00:07:17.879 charts now these were put together
00:07:19.960 yesterday we moved around a bit but suie
00:07:22.879 which you know a the responser of this B
00:07:26.160 as you know I'm on the foundation of sui
00:07:28.240 but as I've always said I'm merary with
00:07:30.039 my Capital this has been one of our core
00:07:32.199 recommendations in both Global macro
00:07:34.160 investor and pro crypto and it's been
00:07:36.080 doing extraordinary well the shortterm
00:07:38.240 chart of this
00:07:41.240 breakout salana here's a daily chart of
00:07:44.919 salana salana had a big wedge pattern
00:07:47.560 big consolidation broke out we're re-
00:07:50.000 wedging right now we should break out
00:07:52.240 again into year end to follow that
00:07:54.800 liquidity pattern
00:07:57.479 banone ethereum this is the weekly chart
00:08:00.319 of ethereum the weekly chart of ethereum
00:08:02.759 hasn't yet broken out but it's very
00:08:05.479 close so whether we break out this month
00:08:08.199 which is my hunch and then maybe retest
00:08:11.879 in the January pullback from liquidity
00:08:15.000 um or we pull back here for a bit and
00:08:17.039 then explode through afterwards either
00:08:19.159 way that chart that wedge pattern to me
00:08:22.240 is one of the most powerful patterns in
00:08:23.919 all of crypto and suggest we've got a
00:08:26.159 very big move in ethereum to come
00:08:30.599 the other thing that I look at is I look
00:08:32.360 at the the cross rates between various
00:08:35.240 crypto to try and pick the strongest one
00:08:37.240 I've already shown that salana is very
00:08:40.760 strong and it's expected to keep going
00:08:42.919 higher but when I compare sui against
00:08:45.480 salana it's starting to break out from
00:08:47.920 this inverse Head and Shoulders pattern
00:08:50.200 which suggests to me that I would switch
00:08:52.959 more assets from salana into s that's
00:08:56.560 not saying salana is going to go down in
00:08:58.959 fact I I think salana does extremely
00:09:01.079 well and you should be overweighted
00:09:03.000 there because it is a second cycle more
00:09:06.040 proven protocol wellu is newer and
00:09:08.760 riskier but it looks like the alpha is
00:09:11.519 going to come from the new token the new
00:09:14.079 performer ofu and we can hear adony
00:09:17.880 talking about this uh later today when
00:09:21.120 um Chris bulock interviews him about
00:09:24.360 s to
00:09:26.160 show another interesting chart I quite
00:09:28.519 like is is Doge sorry xrp has been super
00:09:31.720 strong but really what we've seen is the
00:09:35.200 upward trend of sweet outperformance we
00:09:37.920 hit the bottom of the trend Channel and
00:09:39.959 we're likely to outperform xrp going
00:09:42.200 forwards again in that ongoing relative
00:09:44.839 outperformance again that's not saying
00:09:46.440 xrp goes down but I'm just giving you
00:09:48.920 the perspective of these cross rates to
00:09:51.880 understand the Nuance of markets because
00:09:54.200 really a lot of people have too much
00:09:56.600 assets spread across too many things
00:09:58.959 when you start comparing one asset to
00:10:00.640 the other you can actually narrow it
00:10:02.519 down and concentrate your bets into bets
00:10:05.240 that really matter a lot of the time you
00:10:07.600 think oh I want a bit of this and a bit
00:10:08.880 of that and a bit of this because that's
00:10:10.079 going up and that's going up and that's
00:10:11.279 breaking out you actually underperformed
00:10:13.839 by doing that I found that being more
00:10:16.800 concentrated in my bets using the don't
00:10:19.600  this up thesis which is have let's
00:10:21.959 say 80 or 90% in the main tokens and
00:10:26.880 those would be um salana um Bitcoin
00:10:30.800 ethereum then you can have waiting in
00:10:33.399 whatever you choose it to be where you
00:10:35.639 think you're going to find
00:10:36.720 outperformance including some means
00:10:39.240 which should be a much smaller part of
00:10:40.680 your portfolio because you're likely to
00:10:42.839 get wrecked you'll have fun doing so but
00:10:45.120 you're likely to get ragged okay next
00:10:47.760 chart xrp itself fabulous pattern look
00:10:51.360 at wedge after wedge after wedge after
00:10:53.440 the wedge so we're just building another
00:10:55.800 wedge now ready for the next break
00:10:57.560 higher so that move is clearly not done
00:11:00.519 um if you look at the weekly chart of um
00:11:04.000 xrp it's a stunner this massive 7 year
00:11:07.480 wedges broken who knows where this chart
00:11:10.040 goes to it's very powerful but then go
00:11:12.680 back to that chart of s versus xrp and
00:11:16.760 it's suggesting that s should even
00:11:18.760 outperform this so that's the
00:11:21.120 perspective I have now it's not always
00:11:22.800 going to be 100% right but that's how I
00:11:24.839 look at it um here's s salana
00:11:29.920 so we we've been consolidating the wedge
00:11:32.120 had the huge outperformance
00:11:34.360 consolidation breakout retest the
00:11:36.959 breakout Zone next leg should be S favor
00:11:40.800 because of the long-term chart and this
00:11:42.680 is sorry this is the weekly chart and
00:11:44.680 you saw the daily chart earlier with the
00:11:46.720 inverse Head and Shoulders stuff like
00:11:48.720 that so there's a lot of great charts
00:11:52.000 that are lining up that say
00:11:53.959 banone in mean land whiff dog whiff hat
00:11:57.839 inverse Head and Shoulders broke out
00:11:59.839 retest next leg higher should come
00:12:04.040 shortly Jupiter so Jupiter is
00:12:08.519 a is a it's kind of a leverage bet on
00:12:11.360 Soul because it's a DEX on Soul so more
00:12:14.360 Soul activity more Jupiter goes up so
00:12:17.360 it's broken out as well and looks very
00:12:19.519 positive these kind of wedge patterns
00:12:21.560 that we see are immensely powerful so
00:12:24.120 this is beta to
00:12:26.120 Soul um another one that did a very
00:12:28.680 similar was MOG it had exactly the same
00:12:31.040 wedge and then it exploded higher and
00:12:33.079 it's been exploding higher since as it
00:12:35.279 ended up getting listed on the major
00:12:36.839 exchanges so again you can see these
00:12:39.000 patterns they're human behavior on a
00:12:41.279 chart and they don't all happen at the
00:12:44.160 same time this is the hard thing about
00:12:46.120 the banana zone is different things pop
00:12:48.720 at different times and you you've always
00:12:51.160 trust me always got the feeling you've
00:12:52.760 got the wrong token then yours pumps
00:12:57.279 and then something pumps and you're like
00:13:00.120 do I chase this what have I got it wrong
00:13:02.399 stick with your program you'll probably
00:13:04.600 get it right over time if youve used the
00:13:06.760 don't this up thesis of asset
00:13:09.079 allocation so don't worry fomo is a
00:13:12.360 natural part of this Market the real
00:13:14.880 temptation is to chase every breakout
00:13:18.639 don't do that because they roll over
00:13:21.440 time they repeat the same patterns but
00:13:22.800 they're not all 100% in the same phase
00:13:26.480 the other one that's an absolute stunner
00:13:28.399 of a chart is Doge Doge just keeps doing
00:13:31.600 the same thing every cycle it does
00:13:33.720 consolidation consolidation
00:13:35.120 consolidation explosion consolidation
00:13:37.480 consolidation consolidation explosion
00:13:40.360 the explosion is always the banana Zone
00:13:43.480 and doge is the strongest characteristic
00:13:47.320 of the banana Zone it's this massive
00:13:50.120 meme um that gets the world's attention
00:13:54.120 it has been going since
00:13:55.680 2013 and it has been Unstoppable and
00:13:58.720 look at the breakout levels now if we
00:14:00.720 repeat anything like we did the last two
00:14:03.880 uh banana Zone periods we've got a hell
00:14:06.519 of a ride to come so doge is something
00:14:10.040 that I keep a close focus on um and
00:14:13.639 again once we Zoom down to the shorter
00:14:15.360 term torizon Doge and again this is
00:14:17.720 slightly out of day this from yesterday
00:14:19.600 but doge is wedging yet again these
00:14:22.279 wedges are fabulous patterns in Bull
00:14:25.560 markets or bare markets depending which
00:14:27.600 way you're looking at but they
00:14:29.279 consolidation the pause that refreshes
00:14:31.440 next leg higher so we're expecting any
00:14:34.199 day now digestion of a little bit of the
00:14:37.160 move we had with Bitcoin going to
00:14:40.079 104,000 consolidate consolidate then
00:14:42.839 something will break I don't know what
00:14:44.160 it was uh SOI broke yesterday broke to
00:14:46.759 the upside now it's consolidating maybe
00:14:49.320 it's Doge tomorrow and this rolling
00:14:51.839 breakouts breakouts breakouts is how it
00:14:54.279 happens and consolidation consolidation
00:14:56.360 consolidation and as people build
00:14:58.480 confidence we start moving into okay
00:15:00.959 bigger correction uh to come Doge
00:15:04.680 Bitcoin is like I think the most
00:15:06.279 humorous chart in all of humanity um
00:15:09.120 what it's saying is since Doge came out
00:15:10.880 in 2013 it's outperformed Bitcoin by
00:15:14.920 500% it's suggesting that doge is the
00:15:17.399 hardest currency in the known Galaxy now
00:15:20.360 if that chart plays out um and it breaks
00:15:23.959 that kind of downward sloping uh wedge
00:15:27.079 or or whatever Channel
00:15:29.839 and we go to a new High I mean that's
00:15:32.839 telling us something that we can't get
00:15:34.639 our heads around uh that doge is
00:15:37.920 literally a better currency than Bitcoin
00:15:40.199 and I know that's contentious I'm just
00:15:41.759 looking at the charts I find it
00:15:43.160 hilarious we may be living in a
00:15:44.759 simulation and it's probably Elon
00:15:46.880 simulation therefore this works
00:15:50.240 um one of the memes you all know I've
00:15:52.360 got smoking chicken fish smoking chicken
00:15:54.480 fish did a perfect cons you know rip up
00:15:58.040 and their long-term consolidation which
00:16:00.079 happens to be a wickoff reaccumulation
00:16:02.880 pattern we should expect it to go to the
00:16:05.199 top of the range around
00:16:07.959 the sort of 120 130 level chop around
00:16:13.319 there for a bit and then explode higher
00:16:15.560 so you know you can use these kind of
00:16:17.959 patterns as well but again they're all
00:16:19.959 suggested that we're in the banana Zone
00:16:22.639 the first leg of the banana Zone not
00:16:24.399 everything sinks they come one after the
00:16:26.279 other off the other then we get a big
00:16:28.440 correction and maybe in that bigger
00:16:30.720 correction it could be the Major's
00:16:31.959 correct and the alts explode higher I'm
00:16:35.600 not sure yet we'll have to wait and see
00:16:37.319 I don't trade it and we'll talk about
00:16:39.000 that correction in a bit smoking chicken
00:16:40.800 fish broke out of the downward sloping
00:16:42.600 wedge pattern as well so again just more
00:16:46.720 confirmation here's a leverage play on
00:16:49.560 onu which is deep deep book which is the
00:16:52.920 liquidity layer for S so the more if you
00:16:56.480 think of like the Jupiter idea the more
00:16:58.319 activity that happens onu the more deep
00:17:00.920 book is like to go up and it's like $180
00:17:03.399 million right now as an entire value now
00:17:07.240 if we're right about s that it that it
00:17:09.520 gets into well into the top 10 and
00:17:11.640 potentially the top five in this cycle
00:17:14.359 well the liquidity layer is going to be
00:17:16.039 extremely valuable um so you know there
00:17:18.640 could potentially and it's not not a
00:17:20.520 recommendation but it could do a 10x so
00:17:22.679 this is H saying if there are ways of
00:17:25.359 having leverage plays on top okay let's
00:17:29.240 go back to the liquidity story so the
00:17:31.360 liquidity story here is oh my God and
00:17:34.320 I've been said this chart a thousand
00:17:35.600 times by people oh my God what happens
00:17:37.280 is it all over is this the peak is this
00:17:39.039 the end do we get out now what happens
00:17:41.360 what happens panic panic panic panic
00:17:43.799  okay we had exactly the same
00:17:47.600 thing last time Trump was elected the
00:17:50.240 dollar was strong rates went up
00:17:53.440 liquidity
00:17:54.679 contracted the market had a big rally
00:17:57.679 which is Bitcoin and then in January
00:18:00.440 because of the lag what we found was a
00:18:03.880 sharp 27% correction in
00:18:06.440 Bitcoin um and then it ripped
00:18:10.360 higher ripped higher so much in fact
00:18:14.320 that it went up 23x now I'm not
00:18:17.280 expecting that because this was a much
00:18:18.880 earlier cycle but what we're saying is
00:18:21.640 that correction is not to fear that
00:18:23.400 correction is just a marker point from
00:18:26.480 phase one of the banana Zone to phase
00:18:28.240 two of the ban ban Zone phase two of the
00:18:30.400 banana Zone usually goes into US tax
00:18:32.880 season which is like April um then
00:18:35.960 there's usually a consolidation because
00:18:37.440 people have to sell tokens to pay taxes
00:18:39.679 and then there's usually phase three of
00:18:41.120 the banana zone is the rip into year end
00:18:43.880 and that's all driven by the liquidity
00:18:46.799 cycle so we can see these banana Zone
00:18:49.919 periods as they start appearing Bitcoin
00:18:52.400 just does this every time like Doge does
00:18:56.240 so we've just broken that part of the
00:18:58.159 cycle so this is the start of the banana
00:19:00.640 Zone as we start accelerating higher
00:19:04.000 going back
00:19:05.640 to uh liquidity here's Global M2 you see
00:19:09.400 global M2 does this a lot it also wedges
00:19:11.960 I love a wedge they're the best chart
00:19:13.320 patterns in the world and what happens
00:19:15.240 is it has a break higher than this
00:19:17.640 consolidation it's happened every time
00:19:19.679 we've got to the banan Zone period the
00:19:22.280 kind of us election cycle stuff like
00:19:24.280 that so we've done that we've re we've
00:19:26.679 corrected the breakout now global M2 is
00:19:28.799 actually driven by the strength of the
00:19:30.880 dollar now the dollar has started to
00:19:33.039 weaken we're expected to weaken going
00:19:35.080 forwards um and that will then reignite
00:19:37.799 the next phase of the banana Zone as we
00:19:40.200 start bouncing higher you can see those
00:19:42.280 Corrections in them too were short now
00:19:44.960 the reason being is we've got to roll
00:19:47.240 all of this Global liquidity we've got
00:19:49.600 massive amounts of debt to roll over and
00:19:53.080 you need liquidity to do it so that is
00:19:56.120 the game the big game the everything
00:19:58.080 code game that I've talked you about so
00:20:00.559 the everything go code game is very much
00:20:02.520 at play this is a phase the early phase
00:20:05.080 of the breakout this year is the year of
00:20:08.000 liquidity and that's why the year ahead
00:20:11.559 and that's why the banana Zone plays out
00:20:14.840 so
00:20:16.440 beautifully so we talked about global M2
00:20:19.360 being driven by the dollar so let's look
00:20:22.200 at the dollar and also rates is the
00:20:24.440 other part of um Financial conditions
00:20:26.559 and
00:20:27.360 liquidity so
00:20:29.400 what we're finding is that the dollar as
00:20:32.840 you can see and rates had moved away
00:20:36.200 from Trend that was the strength that we
00:20:38.000 saw this is what creates the the um the
00:20:44.159 down moving Global liquidity now what's
00:20:46.799 interesting is the city economic
00:20:49.080 surprises index which is a index of
00:20:51.919 whether the economy is beating forecast
00:20:55.280 or underperforming forecast says we
00:20:57.799 should now have a period of
00:20:59.039 underperforming forecast because it was
00:21:01.159 driven by the tightener conditions from
00:21:03.320 the dollar and rates now obviously we
00:21:06.360 know if the economy starts
00:21:08.159 underperforming forecast like we just
00:21:10.200 saw the unemployment rate rise to
00:21:12.880 4.2% once we start to see things like
00:21:15.679 that happening what happens is people
00:21:18.240 start thinking about we need to cut
00:21:20.279 rates more so that's a very interesting
00:21:22.960 thing so here in white is is rate Cuts
00:21:26.919 priced in very few rate Cuts priced in
00:21:30.720 so there's
00:21:32.120 like uh I don't know what the scale is
00:21:34.400 here but there's very little rate Cuts
00:21:36.240 priced in but it's
00:21:37.799 driven on a forward basis by the dollar
00:21:41.640 and the long end so it's now saying as
00:21:44.880 we weaken economic growth we should
00:21:47.039 start to see rate cuts and then as you
00:21:50.000 can see we're starting to see the pickup
00:21:52.440 um again in financial conditions which
00:21:54.600 is important and I'll come into that in
00:21:56.320 a
00:21:57.520 minute so when you put it all together
00:21:59.520 they're all the same thing FEG rate cuts
00:22:01.520 the dxy 10-year bond yelds they're all
00:22:04.840 highly mirroing each other 10year Bond
00:22:06.679 deals seem to be suggesting faster and
00:22:09.760 faster that the dollar should roll over
00:22:12.279 and rat should roll over
00:22:14.400 too that creates Financial conditions
00:22:17.159 and now what we've got here is financial
00:22:20.000 conditions index which is um rates the
00:22:23.640 dollar and oil prices has been
00:22:25.919 consolidating for a period of time and
00:22:28.240 it is is suggesting that the ism which
00:22:31.360 is the business cycle The Institute of
00:22:33.039 Supply manager survey should be much
00:22:35.840 higher I.E we've got economic growth to
00:22:38.840 come it leads by nine months so in nine
00:22:40.960 months time the economy will be a lot
00:22:43.640 stronger than it is today and this is
00:22:46.080 going to be important for you so all of
00:22:48.120 the stuff we talked about rates the
00:22:50.080 dollar um even oil prices all Drive
00:22:54.039 Financial conditions which drives
00:22:56.039 cryptocurrencies which drives markets in
00:22:58.159 general
00:22:59.039 which drives the business
00:23:01.000 cycle when we look at the
00:23:02.679 forward-looking basis on the business
00:23:04.279 cycle we can see things like the Philly
00:23:06.360 fed well then new orders index is
00:23:09.240 exploding higher now whether this is
00:23:11.679 just on the Trump Victory or whether
00:23:15.159 it's on um orders they see in advance
00:23:19.039 not sure yet Filly fed um expectations
00:23:22.480 index exploding higher Empire
00:23:25.000 manufacturing for that's for New York
00:23:26.960 exploding higher all suggesting the ism
00:23:29.640 is going to be super strong going
00:23:31.240 forwards why this matters is the ism the
00:23:35.440 business
00:23:37.039 cycle is the coincident factor for the
00:23:41.279 ethereum Bitcoin
00:23:43.480 cross so that says as ISM starts Rising
00:23:48.919 eth Starts outperforming
00:23:51.080 Bitcoin and why is that well it's a
00:23:53.799 function of ism
00:23:56.679 being confidence in the economy
00:23:59.679 disposable income or free cash flows
00:24:02.039 from businesses people get more have
00:24:04.400 more money and feel better and have more
00:24:06.200 confidence as the ism goes up the
00:24:08.080 business Cycle's better we're all
00:24:09.320 earning a bit more our businesses are
00:24:11.080 doing better we're making a bit more
00:24:12.320 profits and we recycle those profits
00:24:14.799 into Investments and we go further out
00:24:17.120 the risk curve which would be ethereum
00:24:19.880 we might also like ethereum because it
00:24:21.360 has a yield while Bitcoin doesn't so we
00:24:23.520 might Park more of our money into that
00:24:25.080 yield as well to make our money grow for
00:24:27.120 us so anyway if a big factor for eth
00:24:31.240 Bitcoin the business cycle crypto and
00:24:33.559 macro are the same thing and that's a
00:24:35.799 really important thing to know most of
00:24:37.960 the financial establishment hasn't
00:24:39.640 understand stood this but um at Global
00:24:42.279 macro investor we have entirely led the
00:24:44.360 way on this we have thousands of charts
00:24:46.559 we have more in-depth research on that
00:24:48.880 Nexus of macro and crypto than literally
00:24:51.360 anybody else on Earth and we're very
00:24:53.200 confident in how this plays out so when
00:24:56.000 we go back to the price chart hey Presto
00:24:58.080 it's another wedge this is the eth
00:25:00.840 Bitcoin weekly cross if you remember
00:25:02.840 when I started this presentation I said
00:25:04.840 stop using too shter term charts because
00:25:07.279 all you'd see on Twitter is eth's
00:25:09.080 terrible it's falling and it's just
00:25:10.880 going to underperform Forever look at
00:25:12.559 the big picture eth basically is the
00:25:15.039 same level versus Bitcoin that it was in
00:25:17.240 2017 it has held value over time which
00:25:20.799 is very important it shows the Lindy
00:25:22.679 effect that this thing is around and
00:25:25.000 it's here to stay so what we're doing is
00:25:27.440 bouncing off the bottom bottom Channel
00:25:28.960 now just as the ism is is about to pick
00:25:31.760 up and we either break that wedge which
00:25:34.520 is a big deal because that would be eth
00:25:37.960 outperforming Bitcoin even further or we
00:25:41.120 stay in that larger range but get to the
00:25:43.200 top of the range my base case is we
00:25:46.960 break out and eth outperforms now I know
00:25:49.640 nobody can believe that right now but
00:25:51.760 eth is a very different Beast to bitcoin
00:25:53.880 ether is a platform it's a compute
00:25:56.520 platform it's a storage platform it's a
00:25:59.279 huge system well Bitcoin is more of a
00:26:03.440 currency a store of value collateral
00:26:05.480 layer they're just very different things
00:26:07.480 and it's kind of stupid and idiotic that
00:26:09.480 we compare them but we're here to make
00:26:12.240 money and not have a philosophical
00:26:14.399 debate about what Bitcoin is versus
00:26:16.200 ethereum what I'm here to do is help all
00:26:19.000 of us unfuck our futures and it feels
00:26:21.480 that overweighting ethereum if you've
00:26:23.840 got ethereum that's the way to do it
00:26:25.919 versus Bitcoin now the ISN also has
00:26:29.120 another little piece of magic it
00:26:31.240 actually is the signifier for altcoin
00:26:34.159 season so altcoins a percent of Bitcoin
00:26:36.960 total market cap altcoins start
00:26:39.120 massively outperforming and again it's
00:26:41.480 driven by the same thing optimism a bit
00:26:44.559 more money a bit more Savings in your
00:26:46.520 pocket and you wanting to make your
00:26:48.360 money work for you you go further out
00:26:50.559 the risk curve so the key signal for for
00:26:55.279 um for altcoin season is the ISM going
00:26:58.960 higher and I've showed you why we think
00:27:01.360 it goes higher all of our work suggests
00:27:03.799 that it will ism is also this chart is
00:27:07.200 the same actually for nfts that's why
00:27:09.480 we've started to see nfts Rise it's all
00:27:11.440 written uh it's all driven by the same
00:27:13.880 thing nfts are people's savings get
00:27:15.919 recycled into a long-term
00:27:18.840 asset and then if we look at the crypto
00:27:21.240 open market cap excluding the top 10
00:27:23.840 known as others on um trading view lo
00:27:27.399 and behold a series of beautiful wedges
00:27:29.880 that wedge pattern is just is the is the
00:27:32.480 chart pattern of the gods that and the
00:27:34.120 head and shoulders pattern and here we
00:27:36.000 go and a couple of the wick offs and
00:27:38.080 here we go wedge massive break wedge
00:27:41.880 massive break
00:27:43.840 wedge I would suggest massive break so
00:27:46.919 where does this go we're at 400 um $400
00:27:50.720 billion dollar here do we go to trillion
00:27:54.519 do6 trillion it's possible it's possible
00:27:58.840 we just have to wait and see but you
00:28:00.559 know the orders of me the previous ones
00:28:03.080 were much larger it'll be less big this
00:28:04.919 side but I'm guessing we're going to see
00:28:07.559 the you know the mid- tier olds really
00:28:10.039 really start to um move in value and
00:28:13.159 that's where things like sui and SE and
00:28:15.679 Celestia and all of these things all lie
00:28:18.600 within these areas or whatever your
00:28:20.720 favorite token is and again please do
00:28:23.679 not think that you need to be a
00:28:25.600 maximalist in anyone thing we're trying
00:28:27.840 to out out perform use the charts of
00:28:29.519 your chosen token versus salana they
00:28:32.200 look like they're going to outperform
00:28:33.240 salana you're on to something good
00:28:35.440 please don't use something that's very
00:28:37.279 short term I want to see a proper basing
00:28:40.039 pattern that's why um I found sui
00:28:42.679 because it was outperforming pretty much
00:28:44.279 every token you might find something
00:28:46.000 else again don't go too far overweight
00:28:48.760 away from the don't this up thesis
00:28:50.760 the way to ride the banana sensibly it
00:28:52.960 will all play
00:28:54.360 out okay so here's our macro seasons in
00:28:57.480 this impossible to see chart and if
00:28:59.159 you've got color blindness you're
00:29:00.760 totally but I'm sorry for that
00:29:03.279 but here we go is we're in crypto summer
00:29:07.120 crypto summer finishes with the start of
00:29:10.519 the banana zone so we saw it well in
00:29:12.720 2020 2016 was great 2012 was great
00:29:17.640 but it is crypto full where the real
00:29:20.360 action starts we look at 13 it was
00:29:22.880 ridiculous 17 was ridiculous 21 was a
00:29:26.559 weird one and it was a weird one
00:29:29.159 actually because of a simple thing is
00:29:31.440 the
00:29:32.399 pandemic had caused a a faster spike in
00:29:36.960 in crypto summer but also the massive
00:29:40.399 liquidity injections started to get
00:29:42.039 withdrawn and the business cycle peaked
00:29:44.399 very quickly in March of
00:29:47.519 2021 and so we had liquidity peaking and
00:29:51.960 the business cycle peak in March 2021
00:29:54.519 and that stopped the second leg of the
00:29:56.679 rally the face three of The banam Zone
00:29:59.919 from really extending like it did in
00:30:02.480 2017 conditions for me are much more
00:30:05.000 similar to
00:30:06.519 2017 and that's what I think so let's
00:30:09.440 compare the previous Cycles now it's a
00:30:10.960 little bit difficult to see with all of
00:30:12.320 the various colors um but basically you
00:30:15.200 can see from the orange the current
00:30:18.240 pattern is looking very similar to
00:30:22.120 either the 2015 18 pattern or the
00:30:26.080 1821 we think it's much closer to the
00:30:29.519 20158 pattern and that we've got um that
00:30:33.640 we've got the an extended move to come
00:30:38.640 an extended banana so I've always been
00:30:40.799 asked and talked about my probability
00:30:42.600 waiting I do not see a peak in the cycle
00:30:45.960 early because guess what the business
00:30:47.840 cycle is at its bottom the White House
00:30:49.840 has just come in with all of the new
00:30:51.200 people their job grow grow grow grow
00:30:52.880 grow they will Force this
00:30:55.000 economy to grow and therefore the
00:30:56.639 business cycle has at least n months
00:30:58.760 probably 12 months to play out we could
00:31:01.240 even see an extended cycle into 2026 but
00:31:04.480 it will be a cycle it will not be a
00:31:05.960 super cycle because liquidity gets
00:31:07.960 withdrawn and then gets eventually
00:31:09.519 readed again as the economy heats up
00:31:13.159 but the back end loaded so we have a a
00:31:17.399 run into year end a
00:31:20.039 correction from liquidity then a run
00:31:23.039 into March April that that usually is
00:31:25.720 altcoin season Central then we tend to
00:31:29.039 have a pause or a pullback post tax
00:31:32.080 season late summer we kick off again
00:31:35.440 2017 we had a Bitcoin 10x in four months
00:31:40.840 so all sorts of drama can happen so the
00:31:44.480 lifestyle chips component that I've
00:31:46.039 talked about a lot I would use probably
00:31:48.440 the the you know Feb March April
00:31:52.440 strength if you want to take some
00:31:54.000 lifetile chps of 20% 15% 30% % 50%
00:31:58.799 whatever it is you want to maintain your
00:32:01.159 lifestyle then you've got the power to
00:32:04.399 run the second half of the bull market
00:32:07.559 because you're going to be in fear all
00:32:09.240 the way am I going to lose my money am I
00:32:10.480 going to get this wrong is it going to
00:32:11.519 be 2021 over again if you've secured
00:32:14.080 that thing your mortgage on your house
00:32:16.200 or your car payment or your that holiday
00:32:18.399 or paid off your debts whatever that
00:32:20.600 lifestyle goal is get that
00:32:22.639 sorted out as fast as possible it will
00:32:24.159 clear your head and allow you to extend
00:32:26.960 the cycle or if not run multicycles the
00:32:29.639 real wealth is actually made not by
00:32:31.639 trading the cycle but by running
00:32:34.000 multicycles because it compounds over
00:32:36.760 time so if you think of you know the the
00:32:39.919 the depths of macro crypto winter in
00:32:45.120 20 in 20 uh n 18 we were down at I don't
00:32:50.799 know 2,000 Bitcoin where are we now 100
00:32:53.200 a 50x you didn't have to do anything you
00:32:56.840 didn't have all the drama all the ups
00:32:58.360 and downs and oh my God FTX and all of
00:33:00.679 this all of it didn't matter so just
00:33:04.159 keep that in mind when you get o all of
00:33:06.200 you are overfocused on the cycle I want
00:33:08.039 to sell at the top and buy at the bottom
00:33:09.679 and I'm going to crush it take your LIF
00:33:11.639 cell chips off you can then run whatever
00:33:13.799 you want so we're getting closer to that
00:33:16.679 period here is the comparison um when
00:33:20.720 you put them all together the uh last
00:33:23.519 two harving and where we are now so
00:33:26.360 where we are now is is um very similar
00:33:31.159 to the white one and the white one is
00:33:33.519 the harving from the 2016 177 cycle now
00:33:37.440 look at both of those charts at exactly
00:33:40.519 like whatever it is 170 days after the
00:33:43.360 harving they both have this correction
00:33:45.639 the liquidity correction it's all the
00:33:47.720 same thing this is the everything code
00:33:49.200 it's all driven by uh liquidity and the
00:33:52.720 Bitcoin harving and the patterns that
00:33:54.360 emerge so that correction however long
00:33:57.159 that takes
00:33:58.600 call it a month three weeks that
00:34:02.080 correction ushers in phase two of the
00:34:05.080 banana Zone which tends to be the
00:34:07.360 violent propulsion of um SS the banana
00:34:11.199 Zone signature pattern so are we
00:34:15.280 overbought yet are we should we be
00:34:16.960 worried should we be thinking you know
00:34:18.800 my God you know what happens if it's
00:34:20.040 over 100,000 and it tops here well our
00:34:23.520 core risk indicator is nowhere near
00:34:26.320 overboard we're still barely
00:34:29.119 mid so it's suggesting we've got a lot
00:34:32.239 further to go when we look at the log
00:34:35.839 regression Channel this is my kind of
00:34:37.239 chart of Truth the thing that I find is
00:34:39.960 immensely helpful well we're not even at
00:34:43.800 the mean of the trend so we're still
00:34:47.239 below mean now we're going to go to one
00:34:50.440 or two standard deviations in fact it's
00:34:52.639 never not gone to two standard
00:34:54.199 deviations two standard deviations you
00:34:57.119 know you're talking
00:34:59.160 $500,000 plus Bitcoin now maybe it
00:35:01.960 doesn't maybe the law of diminishing
00:35:03.400 returns kicks in and gets to one
00:35:04.680 standard deviation well that gets you to
00:35:06.800 250,000 or so I'm not giving you
00:35:09.160 projections I'm giving you
00:35:10.960 contextualization of what an exponential
00:35:13.119 Trend looks like all to play for so
00:35:16.000 there's nothing to worry about cycle top
00:35:19.119 finder this has been a really good way
00:35:21.359 of finding the cycle top we are nowhere
00:35:24.480 there absolutely nowhere near so again
00:35:28.440 chances are we'll have a little pullback
00:35:30.520 uh in in January before well first we
00:35:32.960 hit year end little pullback in January
00:35:35.359 and we'll just keep ripping higher um
00:35:37.880 until we eventually hit the cycle top
00:35:41.560 but that's a long way from now and much
00:35:44.040 later towards the very end of 2025 or
00:35:46.720 even into 2026 we can't tell yet we see
00:35:49.280 how liquidity plays out but that's where
00:35:51.040 we are the bananas then so to picture
00:35:53.960 this if we just followed what happened
00:35:56.400 in 2017
00:35:58.079 the last time Trump got in uh government
00:36:00.480 came in is we had this correction driven
00:36:02.720 by liquidity um it would take us back
00:36:05.160 down to let's say the gap on the chart
00:36:07.480 something like
00:36:09.240 80,000 I I'm not sure that we get that
00:36:13.760 um because of beginning of the year
00:36:16.040 flows from institutions and other
00:36:17.800 players but a correction is the most
00:36:20.599 likely outcome it's very unlikely for it
00:36:22.520 to go in a straight line and you're all
00:36:24.240 going to go what should I do this looks
00:36:25.440 terrifying oh my God oh my God again
00:36:27.319 please please it's noise don't
00:36:29.400  this up says expect 30% pullbacks
00:36:32.319 so please do not start thinking how do I
00:36:34.760 hedge this do I do I top out do I sell M
00:36:37.640 mine up and buy them lower what you'll
00:36:40.319 do is you will lose out and you will
00:36:42.359 miss the rally because you've you've
00:36:44.560 overco complicated a simple trade the
00:36:46.240 simple trade is do nothing so please
00:36:48.920 think about doing nothing we also don't
00:36:50.560 know if Bitcoin Falls where the alts
00:36:53.359 take that pause and everybody focus on
00:36:55.960 alt coins and alts rip higher so we
00:36:58.200 don't know the structure of this so
00:37:00.839 again don't do anything unless it this
00:37:03.920 is why we don't use leverage right so
00:37:06.280 that's my view on this in the end this
00:37:09.839 is the game the game is the banana Zone
00:37:12.960 look where we are we've just started the
00:37:14.839 banana Zone we've had the boring Zone we
00:37:18.079 all suffered that we had a big boring
00:37:20.720 Zone this year much like the
00:37:22.359 2012 boring Zone we've just started now
00:37:25.480 look at the beginning of each one of
00:37:27.200 these there's this little wiggle which
00:37:28.960 is the correction that happens in
00:37:30.880 January great it means nothing on the
00:37:34.520 chart so the banana Zone lies ahead I've
00:37:38.520 given you the Playbook you can if you
00:37:41.319 play it right unfuck your future with
00:37:43.160 the banana ride the banana Zone with me
00:37:46.960 follow the don't this up rules it's
00:37:49.359 all to play for so anyway hopefully this
00:37:52.480 is useful to you I I keep trying to
00:37:54.400 simplify I see the same questions come
00:37:55.960 up and up and up and up and up again you
00:37:57.920 know is the market going to top here
00:37:59.440 what do I do oh my god when do I take
00:38:01.440 lifestyle chips how much seed do I have
00:38:03.560 how much Sal I can't help you with all
00:38:05.760 of these things I can just give you a
00:38:07.200 general contextualization and I hope
00:38:09.200 I've done it here the thing is breathe a
00:38:11.839 little bit go and touch some
00:38:14.599 grass stop hyperfocusing on the five

IMPORTANT INDICATOR => TO PREDICT THE MARKET CYCLE TOP (BITCOIN)
FROM GLOBAL MACRO INVESTOR RAOUL Pal
I don't think Bitcoin has reached its peak!

The GMI Bitcoin Cycle Top Finder (CTF) is an indicator developed by Global Macro Investor (GMI) to 
signal potential market cycle tops for Bitcoin. It typically tracks various on-chain and macroeconomic 
metrics to identify when Bitcoin is reaching its peak price during market cycles. When the CTF spikes 
sharply, it historically aligns with periods of extreme market exuberance, often preceding significant 
corrections or bear markets. In simpler terms, the CTF helps to warn investors when Bitcoin might be 
approaching a cycle top, signaling a potential downturn.
In the current chart, the CTF is much lower compared to previous peaks, suggesting that the market 
may not yet be near a major top, 
which could imply further potential growth for Bitcoin.

00:00:00.080 now look at both of those charts at
00:00:02.480 exactly like whatever it is 170 days
00:00:05.600 after the harving they both have this
00:00:07.600 correction the liquidity correction it's
00:00:09.960 all the same thing this is the
00:00:11.280 everything code it's all driven by uh
00:00:14.240 liquidity and the Bitcoin harving and
00:00:16.239 the patterns that emerge so that
00:00:18.240 correction however long that takes call
00:00:21.160 it a month three weeks that correction
00:00:24.880 ushers in phase two of the banana Zone
00:00:27.560 which tends to be the violent propulsion
00:00:30.599 of ss the banana Zone signature pattern
00:00:34.920 real Vision founder and CEO Raul pal
00:00:38.160 predicted the first part of the banana
00:00:39.920 Zone several months ago he described it
00:00:42.879 as a phase in the cryptocurrency market
00:00:44.920 that typically occurs during periods of
00:00:46.879 heightened Global liquidity leading to
00:00:49.399 Rapid and significant appreciation in
00:00:51.559 crypto assets despite the intense
00:00:54.079 criticisms when the rapid price gains
00:00:56.039 didn't come as expected pal stuck to his
00:00:58.719 guns and insisted that there is a strong
00:01:00.960 correlation between Global liquidity
00:01:02.920 Cycles which have shown clear patterns
00:01:05.159 since 2008 and changes in the financial
00:01:08.280 markets according to Pal's everything
00:01:10.799 code framework Global liquidity Cycles
00:01:13.360 Drive macroeconomic conditions which
00:01:15.960 determine market Cycles especially for
00:01:18.360 secular markets like the crypto Market
00:01:21.360 when we reach certain points of the
00:01:22.880 global liquidity cycle pal believes it's
00:01:25.479 nowhere but up for crypto asset prices
00:01:28.200 because central banks are certain to
00:01:29.680 provide provide the needed push for
00:01:31.079 prices in the form of various
00:01:32.600 quantitative easing exercises such as
00:01:35.079 interest rate Cuts stimulus packages and
00:01:37.880 straight to the point money printing in
00:01:40.159 the past few weeks we've seen Pal's
00:01:42.240 predictions play out almost perfectly
00:01:44.520 with Bitcoin prices hitting multiple
00:01:46.439 all-time highs including its current
00:01:48.799 all-time high of
00:01:52.399 8,398
00:01:54.079 7 other cryptocurrencies also saw
00:01:57.079 significant price increases with
00:01:59.119 altcoins like xrp cardano salana and sui
00:02:03.600 hitting record multi-month and
00:02:05.520 multi-year highs prices have however
00:02:08.639 slowed down temporarily a brief phase of
00:02:11.360 consolidation pal says is to be expected
00:02:13.800 during every crypto bull market in a
00:02:16.360 recent video uploaded on his Raul pal
00:02:18.879 the journeyman YouTube channel pal
00:02:21.120 describes the ongoing consolidation as
00:02:23.519 the selloff before blastoff he predicts
00:02:26.480 that we are nearly upon Phase 2 of the
00:02:28.560 banana Zone which will coincide with the
00:02:30.720 much anticipated altcoin season with
00:02:33.280 crypto prices rising even faster and
00:02:35.720 more rapidly than Phase 1 pal says this
00:02:39.360 next phase of the bull market could
00:02:40.920 begin very quickly as we enter the New
00:02:42.959 Year taking Bitcoin and other
00:02:44.760 cryptocurrencies to unprecedented highs
00:02:47.000 in the blink of an eye as we bring you
00:02:49.400 clips from Pal's video please take a
00:02:51.480 little time to like this video subscribe
00:02:53.720 to the channel and turn on post
00:02:55.480 notifications for more videos like this
00:02:58.040 thanks for the support and enjoy the
00:02:59.680 video video so let's compare the
00:03:01.680 previous Cycles now that's a little bit
00:03:03.239 difficult to see with all of the various
00:03:04.920 colors um but basically you can see from
00:03:07.720 the orange the current pattern is
00:03:10.480 looking very similar to either the 2015
00:03:15.360 18 pattern or the
00:03:16.959 1821 we think it's much closer to the
00:03:20.440 20158 pattern and that we've got um that
00:03:24.519 we've got the an extended move to come
00:03:29.239 an extended banana so I've always been
00:03:31.400 asked and talked about my probability
00:03:33.080 waiting I do not see a peak in the cycle
00:03:36.360 early because guess what the business
00:03:38.239 cycle is at its bottom the White House
00:03:40.239 has just come in with all of the new
00:03:41.599 people their job grow grow grow grow
00:03:43.280 grow they will force this economy to
00:03:45.879 grow and therefore the business cycle
00:03:47.640 has at least nine months probably 12
00:03:49.840 months to play out we could even see an
00:03:52.000 extended cycle into 2026 but it will be
00:03:55.159 a cycle it will not be a super cycle
00:03:57.280 because liquidity gets withdrawn and
00:03:59.040 then gets eventually re added again as
00:04:01.079 the economy heats up but the back end
00:04:04.079 loaded so we have a a run into year end
00:04:07.840 a correction from liquidity then a run
00:04:10.840 into March April that that usually is
00:04:13.560 altcoin season Central then we tend to
00:04:16.399 have a pause or a pullback post tax
00:04:19.238 season late summer we kick off again
00:04:22.479 2017 we had a Bitcoin 10x in four months
00:04:26.600 so all sorts of drama can happen so the
00:04:30.080 lifestyle chips component that I've
00:04:31.639 talked about a lot I would use probably
00:04:34.000 the the you know Feb March April
00:04:37.919 strength if you want to take some
00:04:39.440 lifestle chps of 20% 15% 30% 50%
00:04:44.160 whatever it is you want to maintain your
00:04:46.520 lifestyle then you've got the power to
00:04:49.759 run the second half of the bull market
00:04:52.680 because you're going to be in fear all
00:04:54.360 the way am I going to lose my money am I
00:04:55.560 going to get this wrong is it going to
00:04:56.600 be 2021 over again if you've secured
00:04:59.199 that thing your mortgage on your house
00:05:01.320 or your car payment or your that holiday
00:05:03.520 or paid off your debts whatever that
00:05:05.720 lifestyle goal is get that and sort it
00:05:08.080 out as fast as possible it will clear
00:05:09.520 your head and allow you to extend the
00:05:12.280 cycle or if not run multicycles the real
00:05:15.000 wealth is actually made not by trading
00:05:17.080 the cycle but by running multicycles
00:05:19.759 because it compounds over time so if you
00:05:22.240 think of you know the the the depths of
00:05:25.520 macro crypto winter in 20 in 20 uh n 18
00:05:32.000 we were down at I don't know 2,000
00:05:34.120 Bitcoin where are we now 100,00 a 50x
00:05:37.360 you didn't have to do anything you
00:05:39.039 didn't have all the drama all the ups
00:05:40.560 and downs and oh my God FTX and all of
00:05:42.759 this all of it didn't matter so just
00:05:45.479 keep that in mind when you get o all of
00:05:47.560 you are overfocused on the cycle I want
00:05:49.400 to sell at the top and buy at the bottom
00:05:51.000 and I'm going to crush it take your
00:05:52.800 lifestyle chips off you can then run
00:05:54.840 whatever you want so we're getting
00:05:56.600 closer to that period here is the
00:05:58.800 comparison
00:06:00.240 um when you put them all together the uh
00:06:03.639 last two halings and where we are now so
00:06:06.560 where we are now is um very similar to
00:06:11.160 the white one and the white one is the
00:06:13.520 Haring from the 2016 17 cycle now look
00:06:17.400 at both of those charts at exactly like
00:06:20.440 whatever it is 170 days after the
00:06:23.039 harving they both have this correction
00:06:25.360 the liquidity correction it's all the
00:06:27.400 same thing this is the everything code
00:06:28.880 it's all driven
00:06:30.440 by uh liquidity and the Bitcoin harving
00:06:33.120 and the patterns that emerge so that
00:06:35.240 correction however long that takes call
00:06:38.199 it a month three weeks that correction
00:06:41.840 ushers in phase two of the banana Zone
00:06:44.520 which tends to be the violent propulsion
00:06:47.520 of um SS the banana Zone signature
00:06:51.240 pattern so are we overbought yet are we
00:06:54.440 should we be worried should we be
00:06:55.800 thinking you know my God you know what
00:06:57.560 happens if it's over 100,000 CPS here
00:07:00.720 well our core risk indicator is nowhere
00:07:04.000 near overboard we're still barely mid so
00:07:07.599 it's suggesting we've got a lot further
00:07:09.840 to go when we look at the log regression
00:07:12.840 Channel this is my kind of chart of
00:07:14.440 Truth the thing that I find is immensely
00:07:17.360 helpful well we're not even at the mean
00:07:21.560 of the trend so we're still below mean
00:07:24.919 now we're going to go to one or two
00:07:27.120 standard deviations in fact it's never
00:07:28.879 not gone to two standard deviations two
00:07:31.280 standard deviations you know you're
00:07:33.400 talking
00:07:34.800 $500,000 plus Bitcoin now maybe it
00:07:37.599 doesn't maybe the law of diminishing
00:07:39.000 returns kicks in and gets to one
00:07:40.319 standard deviation well that gets you to
00:07:42.440 250,000 or so I'm not giving you
00:07:44.800 projections I'm giving you
00:07:46.599 contextualization of what an exponential
00:07:48.800 Trend looks like all to play for so
00:07:51.400 there's nothing to worry about cycle top
00:07:53.879 finder this has been a really good way
00:07:56.120 of finding the cycle top we are nowhere
00:07:59.120 there absolutely nowhere near so again
00:08:02.800 chances are we'll have a little pullback
00:08:04.840 uh in in January before we first we'll
00:08:07.319 hit year end little pullback in January
00:08:09.720 and we'll just keep ripping higher um
00:08:12.199 until we eventually hit the cycle top
00:08:15.919 but that's a long way from now and much
00:08:18.400 later towards the very end of 2025 or
00:08:21.080 even into 2026 we can't tell yet you see
00:08:23.639 how liquidity plays out but that's where
00:08:25.400 we are the bananas then so a picture
00:08:27.960 this if we just followed what happened
00:08:30.280 in 2017 the last time Trump got in uh
00:08:33.919 government came in is we had this
00:08:35.880 correction driven by liquidity um it
00:08:38.200 would take us back down to let's say the
00:08:40.599 gap on the chart something like 880,000
00:08:43.679 I I'm not sure that we get that um
00:08:47.320 because of beginning of the year flows
00:08:49.519 from institutions and other players but
00:08:52.000 a correction is the most likely outcome
00:08:54.399 it's very unlikely for it to go in a
00:08:56.000 straight line and you're all going to go
00:08:57.640 what should I do this looks terrifying
00:08:58.920 oh my God my God again please it's noise
00:09:02.279 don't this up says expect 30% pullbacks
00:09:05.240 so please do not start thinking how do I
00:09:07.720 hedge this do I do I top out do I sell
00:09:10.320 my mine up and buy them lower what
00:09:12.480 you'll do is you will lose out and you
00:09:15.079 will missed the rally because you've
00:09:17.160 you've over complicated a simple trade
00:09:19.120 the simple trade is do nothing so please
00:09:21.640 think about doing nothing we also don't
00:09:23.240 know if Bitcoin Falls whether alts take
00:09:26.440 that pause and everybody focus on
00:09:28.720 altcoins and El rip higher so we don't
00:09:31.320 know the structure of this so again
00:09:34.279 don't do anything unless it this is why
00:09:36.720 we don't use leverage right so that's my
00:09:39.120 view on this in the end this is the game
00:09:42.560 the game is the banana Zone look where
00:09:44.680 we are we've just started the banana
00:09:46.519 Zone we've had the boring Zone we all
00:09:48.800 suffered that we had a big boring Zone
00:09:51.480 this year much like the 200 12 boring
00:09:54.240 Zone we've just started now look at the
00:09:56.440 beginning of each one of these there's
00:09:58.440 this little wiggle which is the
00:09:59.760 correction that happens in January great
00:10:02.680 it means nothing on the chart so the
00:10:05.399 banana Zone lies ahead the corrections
00:10:08.360 mean nothing not just because we've seen
00:10:10.600 them play out multiple times during
00:10:12.279 previous Cycles but also because of what
00:10:14.519 lies ahead when this phase ends
00:10:17.399 according to Pal what lies ahead is
00:10:19.800 Bitcoin hitting more milestones and
00:10:21.839 higher all-time highs and other
00:10:23.920 cryptocurrencies like ethereum salana
00:10:26.880 Dogecoin and sui outperforming the
00:10:29.480 largest cryptocurrency and hitting new
00:10:31.839 all-time highs before the cycle Peaks
00:10:34.160 toward the end of the year to be
00:10:36.240 adequately prepared for the good and bad
00:10:38.279 moments that will be sure to come with
00:10:40.079 these intense and Rapid price movements
00:10:42.560 pal suggests taking some lifestyle chips
00:10:44.880 off the table before tax season in March
00:10:47.480 so you have the mental strength to face
00:10:49.320 the rest of the bull market and
00:10:50.800 succeeding Cycles in his video the real
00:10:54.120 Vision CEO provides more tips about
00:10:56.600 navigating crypto Market Cycles he also
00:10:59.639 discusses important economic indicators
00:11:02.120 and crypto market dynamics identifying
00:11:04.760 the correlation between them and what
00:11:06.760 this means for crypto prices going
00:11:08.760 forward let's get back to the video okay
00:11:11.920 let's go back to the liquidity story so
00:11:14.120 the liquidity story here is oh my God
00:11:17.000 and I've been set this chart a thousand
00:11:18.440 times by people oh my God what happens
00:11:20.120 is it all over is this the peak is this
00:11:21.920 the end do we get out now what happens
00:11:24.200 what happens panic panic panic panic
00:11:25.880  okay we had exactly the same
00:11:28.959 thing
00:11:29.880 last time Trump was elected the dollar
00:11:31.800 was strong rates went up liquidity
00:11:34.920 contracted the market had a big rally
00:11:37.920 which is Bitcoin and then in January
00:11:40.560 because of the lag what we found was a
00:11:43.560 sharp 27% correction in Bitcoin um and
00:11:46.959 then it ripped higher ripped higher so
00:11:50.000 much in fact that it went up 23x now I'm
00:11:54.000 not expecting that because this was a
00:11:55.600 much earlier cycle but what we're saying
00:11:58.320 is that correction is not to fear that
00:12:00.279 correction is just a marker point from
00:12:02.760 phase one of the banana Zone to phase
00:12:04.519 two of the banana Zone phase two of the
00:12:06.680 banana Zone usually goes into US tax
00:12:09.160 season which is like April um then
00:12:12.200 there's usually a consolidation because
00:12:13.639 people have to sell tokens to pay taxes
00:12:15.920 and then there's usually phase three of
00:12:17.360 the banana zone is the rip into year end
00:12:20.120 and that's all driven by the liquidity
00:12:21.839 cycle so we can see these banan Zone
00:12:24.760 periods as they start appearing Bitcoin
00:12:27.279 just does this every time
00:12:29.760 like Doge does so we've just broken that
00:12:32.519 part of the cycle so this is the start
00:12:34.720 of the banana Zone as we start
00:12:36.600 accelerating higher going back to uh
00:12:40.959 liquidity here's Global M2 you see
00:12:43.279 global M2 does this a lot it also wedges
00:12:45.839 I love a wed they're the best CH
00:12:47.199 patterns in the world and what happens
00:12:49.120 is it has a break higher than this
00:12:51.560 consolidation it's happened every time
00:12:53.600 we've got to the banana Zone period the
00:12:56.120 kind of us election cycle stuff like
00:12:58.120 that so we've done that we've re we've
00:13:00.519 corrected the breakout now global M2 is
00:13:02.600 actually driven by the strength of the
00:13:04.720 dollar now the dollar has started to
00:13:06.839 weaken we're expected to weaken going
00:13:08.920 forwards um and that will then reignite
00:13:11.639 the next phase of the banana Zone as we
00:13:14.040 start bouncing higher you can see those
00:13:16.120 Corrections in them too were short now
00:13:18.800 the reason being is we've got to roll
00:13:21.079 all of this Global liquidity we've got
00:13:23.480 massive amounts of debt to roll over and
00:13:26.880 you need liquidity to do it so that is
00:13:29.639 the game the big game the everything
00:13:31.639 code game that I've talked you about so
00:13:33.839 the everything Cod code game is very
00:13:35.600 much at play this is a phase the early
00:13:38.079 phase of the breakout this year is the
00:13:40.720 year of liquidity and that's why the
00:13:43.760 year ahead and that's why the banana
00:13:46.480 Zone plays out so beautifully so we
00:13:50.199 talked about global M2 being driven by
00:13:52.240 the dollar so let's look at the dollar
00:13:54.920 and also rates is the other part of um
00:13:57.440 Financial conditions and liquidity
00:13:59.880 so what we're finding is that the dollar
00:14:04.000 as you can see and rates had moved away
00:14:07.079 from Trend that was the strength that we
00:14:08.800 saw this is what creates the the um the
00:14:14.199 down moving Global liquidity now what's
00:14:16.839 interesting is the city economic
00:14:19.120 surprises index which is a index of
00:14:21.920 whether the economy is beating forecast
00:14:24.959 or underperforming forecast says we
00:14:27.480 should now have a period of under
00:14:29.160 performing forecast because it was
00:14:30.880 driven by the tighten of conditions from
00:14:33.040 the dollar and rates now obviously we
00:14:36.120 know if the economy starts
00:14:37.880 underperforming forecast like we just
00:14:39.920 saw the unemployment rate rise to
00:14:42.519 4.2% once we start to see things like
00:14:45.279 that happening what happens is people
00:14:47.800 start thinking about we need to cut
00:14:49.880 rates more so that's a very interesting
00:14:52.399 thing so here in white is is rate Cuts
00:14:56.120 priced in very few rate Cuts priced in
00:14:59.680 so there's like uh I don't know what the
00:15:01.800 scale is here but there's very little
00:15:03.720 rate Cuts priced in but it's driven on a
00:15:06.399 forward basis by the dollar and the long
00:15:09.360 end so it's now saying as we weaken
00:15:12.600 economic growth we should start to see
00:15:14.720 rate cuts and then as you can see we're
00:15:17.320 starting to see the pickup um again in
00:15:19.959 financial conditions which is important
00:15:21.920 and I'll come to that in a minute so
00:15:23.839 when you put it all together they're all
00:15:25.040 the same thing FEG rate cuts the dxy
00:15:27.639 10-year bond yields they're all highly
00:15:30.240 mirroring each other 10-year bond yelds
00:15:32.720 seem to be suggesting faster and faster
00:15:35.880 that the dollar should roll over and rat
00:15:37.839 should roll over too that creates
00:15:40.240 Financial conditions and now what we've
00:15:42.000 got here is financial conditions index
00:15:44.839 which is um rates the dollar and oil
00:15:48.680 prices has been consolidating for a
00:15:50.759 period of time and it is suggesting that
00:15:54.120 the ism which is the business cycle The
00:15:56.480 Institute of Supply manager survey
00:15:58.560 should be much higher I.E we've got
00:16:01.600 economic growth to come it leads by 9
00:16:03.920 months so in 9 months time the economy
00:16:06.560 will be a lot stronger than it is today
00:16:09.360 and this is going to be important for
00:16:10.720 you so all of the stuff we talked about
00:16:12.720 rates the dollar um even oil prices all
00:16:17.120 Drive Financial conditions which drives
00:16:19.440 cryptocurrencies which drives markets in
00:16:21.680 general which drives the business cycle
00:16:24.319 when we look at the forward-looking
00:16:25.480 basis on the business cycle we can see
00:16:27.360 things like the Philly fed well then new
00:16:29.680 orders index is exploding higher now
00:16:32.319 whether this is just on the Trump
00:16:34.880 Victory or whether it's on um orders
00:16:38.720 they see in advance not sure yet Philly
00:16:41.480 fed um expectations index exploding
00:16:44.560 higher Empire manufacturing for that's
00:16:46.880 for New York exploding higher all
00:16:49.480 suggesting the ism is going to be super
00:16:51.480 strong going forwards Pal's deep rooted
00:16:53.519 conviction in cryptocurrencies and
00:16:55.199 digital assets is a result of several
00:16:57.639 interconnected macro economic
00:16:59.920 technological and structural factors he
00:17:03.120 emphasizes the role of liquidity in
00:17:05.079 driving financial markets arguing that
00:17:07.679 cryptocurrencies act as high beta plays
00:17:09.880 on global liquidity during periods of
00:17:12.760 increasing liquidity for example when
00:17:15.280 central banks ease monetary policy or
00:17:17.839 inject funds into the economy digital
00:17:20.559 assets tend to outperform traditional
00:17:22.599 asset classes Central bank's loose
00:17:25.039 monetary policies and excessive money
00:17:27.119 printing erode the value of
00:17:29.440 currencies pal views Bitcoin and other
00:17:31.960 digital assets as Hedges against this
00:17:33.919 debasement offering protection and
00:17:36.080 long-term value preservation he sums up
00:17:39.080 this thesis in a recent tweet that reads
00:17:41.640 eventually Maybe by 2030 everyone will
00:17:44.679 finally realize the bubble isn't in
00:17:46.720 asset prices but in liquidity used to
00:17:49.440 service the global government debts
00:17:52.039 Global liquidity lowers the denominator
00:17:54.840 debasement crypto is the life raft
00:17:57.200 because the asset class outperformed
00:17:59.240 massively in addition digital assets are
00:18:02.159 at the Forefront of technological change
00:18:04.640 offering solutions for decentralized
00:18:06.640 finance Defi tokenization and ownership
00:18:10.240 in the digital economy Beyond currencies
00:18:13.360 blockchain technology is enabling new
00:18:15.559 sectors including tokenized real estate
00:18:18.320 supply chain gaming gamey and
00:18:21.320 non-fungible tokens
00:18:23.480 nfts pal considers these Innovations
00:18:26.280 transformative creating new
00:18:27.960 opportunities for value capture lastly
00:18:31.039 cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks
00:18:33.120 follow meta's law where their value
00:18:35.640 increases exponentially with more users
00:18:38.720 pal believes that the adoption curve of
00:18:40.600 crypto assets resembles that of the
00:18:42.640 internet in its early stages suggesting
00:18:45.159 a massive upside as adoption grows he
00:18:48.320 predicts that the crypto Market could
