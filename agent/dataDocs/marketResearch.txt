Based on insights from macro investors and crypto influencers, here are 10 key indicators and signals to watch to identify the crypto market top and take profits effectively:

Global Liquidity Peaks
Watch for a slowdown in global liquidity growth, often a precursor to market corrections. Raoul Pal emphasizes tracking central bank policies, as tightening liquidity can signal a market top【69】【70】.

Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD)
A sharp rise in Bitcoin dominance followed by its decline often indicates the end of the cycle, as capital moves from altcoins back into Bitcoin before exiting the market【71】.

Extreme Greed in Fear and Greed Index
This index measures market sentiment. When it hits extreme greed consistently, it often precedes a significant market correction【72】.

Parabolic Price Action
When prices, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, rise parabolically without substantial corrections, it can signal unsustainable market euphoria【70】【73】.

On-Chain Metrics
Monitor metrics like long-term holder profit-taking, realized profit/loss ratios, and miner activity. Elevated profit-taking or miner sell-offs often indicate the top【73】.

Altcoin Overperformance
Historically, an altcoin rally that significantly outpaces Bitcoin's gains suggests an overheated market nearing its peak【70】.

Stablecoin Supply Decline
A drop in stablecoin supply can indicate reduced buying power in the market, often signaling a top as liquidity diminishes【71】.

Price Divergences
When large-cap cryptos rally while small-cap tokens start declining, it suggests weakening market breadth—a potential warning sign【73】.

Macroeconomic Factors
Pay attention to interest rate changes, fiscal stimulus cycles, and inflation data. A shift toward hawkish monetary policy typically impacts speculative assets like crypto【70】.

Institutional Selling or Distribution
Look for spikes in exchange inflows by whales or institutions, as this often precedes significant sell-offs【69】【72】.

Staying informed on these indicators can help you navigate the market top effectively. Combine these insights with your risk tolerance and trading strategy for optimal decision-making. Always conduct personal research and consider seeking professional financial advice.

00:00:00.000 will there be another financial
00:00:01.760 crisis yeah yeah you think of course

00:00:17.760 paper over the cracks the more they pump
00:00:19.720 in liquidity the more monetary inflation
00:00:21.880 you get the higher the gold price goes
00:00:23.800 and the higher Bitcoin goes enjoy the

00:01:20.000 that block fio but you all know what
00:01:21.759 happened
00:01:26.159 there hey everyone I'm here in London
00:01:28.799 with the king of liquidity
00:01:30.600 himself Michael Howell so Michael is the
00:01:32.680 managing director of crossb capital the
00:01:35.320 de developer of the global liquidity
00:01:37.200 cycle and the author of Capital
00:01:39.439 Wars um maybe first of all for all the
00:01:42.360 viewers uh who might not know you uh
00:01:44.680 could you briefly introduce yourself and
00:01:46.680 why have you been watching liquidity for
00:01:48.799 so long and since when okay well um hi
00:01:52.560 Jack great to be here much looking
00:01:53.920 forward to our discussion um if I go
00:01:57.200 back in my career and basically I
00:01:59.039 started off in Investment Banking uh
00:02:01.840 with a US firm called Salomon Brothers
00:02:04.240 um Salomon Brothers was the uh probably
00:02:06.880 the bond markets worldwide it was the
00:02:08.679 biggest fixed income Trader worldwide it
00:02:11.520 uh did lots of work in Forex markets it
00:02:13.879 was uh basically trying to understand or
00:02:16.080 actually it was it was transacting a lot
00:02:18.319 of these Capital flows that we now
00:02:20.319 describe and uh part of the research
00:02:23.000 process that Salomon Brothers was
00:02:24.400 actually understanding uh the direction
00:02:27.000 and the size of capital flow worldwide
00:02:30.080 and the view very much was if you could
00:02:31.920 understand the flow you really
00:02:32.959 understood how markets were likely to
00:02:34.920 move so it came from practice you know
00:02:38.000 looking at how markets operated and uh
00:02:40.560 basically doing an awful lot of data
00:02:42.159 collection and that's pretty much what
00:02:43.760 we've been doing um you know for 25
00:02:46.159 years since then so it's collecting data
00:02:48.680 from central banks colle collecting data
00:02:51.360 on Capital flow worldwide and putting
00:02:53.200 that together in a framework that allows
00:02:56.000 us to understand uh Global liquidity
00:02:58.519 movements and hence there impact on
00:03:00.440 asset markets yeah so that's why I want
00:03:02.560 to talk about you today so basically
00:03:04.360 today we're going to talk about how
00:03:05.959 Global liquidity affects Bitcoin but
00:03:08.680 first we need to understand so Michael
00:03:10.680 what is global
00:03:12.159 liquidity the way that we Define it is
00:03:14.680 the flow of money uh by that we mean um
00:03:19.159 credit and savings through financial
00:03:22.440 markets uh it's not and I I stress this
00:03:25.560 point because it's important to say what
00:03:26.840 it isn't it isn't traditional measures
00:03:28.720 of money supply like M2 or M1 or these
00:03:31.400 sort of things they are really measuring
00:03:34.040 uh if you like money in banks in High
00:03:35.799 Street Banks and if you believe that
00:03:37.400 retail deposits in banks are what the
00:03:39.799 financial system is about well you know
00:03:41.680 I'll come quietly but unfortunately the
00:03:43.640 world has moved on an awful lot in 20 or
00:03:46.080 30 years we now look at very broad uh
00:03:49.560 measures of liquidity that include
00:03:51.000 Shadow Banks include what central banks
00:03:53.120 do include what uh foreign investors are
00:03:55.400 doing cross border so it's a very very
00:03:57.480 broad uh analysis of uh of flows of
00:04:00.480 capital or flows of money and can you
00:04:02.680 maybe continue on the difference between
00:04:04.640 Global M2 and uh Global liquidity
00:04:07.280 because when I look at a lot of analysis
00:04:09.920 I see a lot of analysts just saying
00:04:12.000 Global liquidity is global M2 but that's
00:04:14.360 not the case yeah I think one of the one
00:04:16.478 of the great problems with with
00:04:17.600 economics is that uh uh things that you
00:04:20.120 can measure easily become very important
00:04:23.120 uh because a lot of people are very lazy
00:04:24.840 and they don't dig behind uh publish
00:04:27.000 statistics and the problem with looking
00:04:29.560 at things like M2 is that M2 is really
00:04:31.840 measuring uh the deposits in other words
00:04:35.039 the uh the liabilities side of retail or
00:04:38.360 High Street Banks Now High Street banks
00:04:41.240 are no longer the main stay of the
00:04:42.919 financial system uh if you look globally
00:04:46.400 uh the answer would be that probably
00:04:48.199 they are responsible for maybe something
00:04:50.680 like 40% of total credit so uh they're
00:04:53.759 important but they're certainly not the
00:04:55.320 the the the big size they used to be uh
00:04:58.240 if we go back maybe 4 50 years then I'll
00:05:01.000 accept the fact that High Street Banks
00:05:02.880 were very important in the financial
00:05:04.320 system now they've been eclipsed by lots
00:05:06.560 of other forms of credit Shadow bunch I
00:05:08.680 mentioned central banks are important uh
00:05:11.360 you know there a lot of credit which is
00:05:13.120 uh uh basically created through what are
00:05:15.160 called FX swaps uh these are things
00:05:17.320 which are outside the normal remit of
00:05:19.360 High Street Banks yeah so you touched a
00:05:21.680 little bit on it so um what are
00:05:24.400 generally the main drivers of global
00:05:27.639 liquidity well the answer comes down to
00:05:30.479 really really two factors one is what
00:05:32.639 the central banks are doing um and uh
00:05:36.319 you know we can drill down into that
00:05:38.039 that equation but what that really boils
00:05:40.199 down to is essentially trying to
00:05:41.880 understand the the two big central banks
00:05:44.039 in the world uh one is the Federal
00:05:46.199 Reserve maybe quite obviously and the
00:05:47.960 other is the People's Bank of China and
00:05:50.000 they tend to their influence tends to be
00:05:52.120 rather different so the Federal Reserve
00:05:54.520 if it changes uh the structure of its
00:05:56.639 balance sheet or eases credit it will
00:05:58.919 have a major effect on financial markets
00:06:01.080 and financial asset prices uh and that's
00:06:03.520 largely because uh we're on a US dollar
00:06:05.960 standard if the People's Bank of China
00:06:08.360 changed monetary policy it tends to
00:06:10.360 affect the tempo of the Chinese economy
00:06:12.599 and because the Chinese economy has such
00:06:14.199 a large industrial footprint uh it will
00:06:17.160 affect then global economic activity and
00:06:19.919 commodity markets so you could broadly
00:06:22.120 say in very crude terms that the Federal
00:06:24.440 Reserve controls the asset markets and
00:06:27.360 the pboc The People's Bank of China
00:06:29.599 controls commodity markets now that's
00:06:32.599 the Central Bank element there's another
00:06:34.720 element that we've got to think about
00:06:36.080 which is how the private sector then
00:06:38.319 creates credit from that base and what's
00:06:40.960 important to understand then is
00:06:43.160 collateral and ever since the uh Global
00:06:46.520 financial crisis in 2008 pretty much all
00:06:49.639 lending now is somehow collaterally
00:06:51.639 based now many people will be familiar
00:06:53.919 with collateral in the sense of thinking
00:06:55.680 of a home mortgage so if you're
00:06:57.319 borrowing money to purchase a house the
00:07:00.280 loan is collateralized or backed by the
00:07:03.120 real estate that you're buying so that's
00:07:04.759 a mortgage uh but most lending now is
00:07:08.080 sort of mortgage like in a sense that it
00:07:09.879 has collateral but that collateral tends
00:07:12.199 to be uh things like uh government bonds
00:07:15.479 and the most frequently used collateral
00:07:18.440 is US Government treasuries um so those
00:07:21.879 treasuries back lending now that makes
00:07:25.160 up the collateral base of the financial
00:07:27.160 system and it operates alongside what
00:07:29.680 the central banks are doing and we think
00:07:32.440 of what's called a collateral multiplier
00:07:35.240 in other words how many times that
00:07:36.879 collateral can be used uh and reused
00:07:39.560 within the financial system and that
00:07:41.639 collateral multiplier tends to be
00:07:43.879 something like about one and 3/4 times
00:07:47.120 so every uh let's say every $100 of
00:07:50.000 collateral in the form of let's say
00:07:51.840 treasuries can be multipied can almost
00:07:54.599 be doubled in effect its effect on
00:07:56.680 creating liquidity now what affects the
00:07:59.159 SI of that multiplier is basically the
00:08:02.440 assessment of credit providers in other
00:08:04.759 words uh those people that are making
00:08:06.599 the loans as to how volatile or how uh
00:08:10.159 or the prospective prices of the
00:08:12.879 collateral in the future so for example
00:08:15.560 if the collateral that you're posting uh
00:08:17.919 a Government Bond or you take my analogy
00:08:20.199 of a of a house uh goes down in value
00:08:23.360 substantially then they would want
00:08:25.680 protection the lender would want
00:08:27.159 protection against that risk so the way
00:08:29.639 they judg that is looking at the
00:08:31.200 volatility of the collateral given the
00:08:33.958 fact that it's mostly these days
00:08:35.440 government bonds uh what is important to
00:08:38.760 look at is something like the move index
00:08:41.240 the move index is like the VIX Index but
00:08:43.679 the move index measures bond market
00:08:45.600 volatility across the US Treasury curve
00:08:48.320 and the move index tends to influence
00:08:50.440 the amount of uh or the effective use of
00:08:52.959 collateral in the system in other words
00:08:54.720 it drives the collateral multiplier so
00:08:57.120 what I tend to say as a quick and dirty
00:08:58.920 way of understanding liquidity is to say
00:09:01.000 look you really need to look at three
00:09:02.519 basic things one is what the Federal
00:09:04.560 Reserve is doing in terms of its
00:09:05.800 liquidity injections two what the
00:09:07.800 People's Bank of China is doing with its
00:09:09.519 liquidity injections and three the
00:09:12.440 effectiveness of collateral measured
00:09:14.360 through the move index and if you get a
00:09:16.160 falling move index and Rising liquidity
00:09:19.000 inflows from those two central banks
00:09:20.920 then Global liquidity tends to rise yeah
00:09:23.800 and also uh from your book I read uh
00:09:26.160 crossborder uh Capital flows are very
00:09:28.360 important um maybe if you could
00:09:30.000 elaborate on that a little bit more
00:09:31.480 because um let's say if you send money
00:09:34.120 from one country to another country how
00:09:35.839 does this add liquidity is it because of
00:09:38.240 the extra credit creation or The
00:09:39.720 Leverage or how does that work well it's
00:09:41.640 a great question I think it's uh I think
00:09:43.480 one's got to uh one has to clearly bring
00:09:45.959 into account crossb flows uh they're a
00:09:48.880 vital part of the International
00:09:50.399 Financial system and the way that they
00:09:52.399 operate is that uh if you've got uh
00:09:55.040 let's say you've got dollars which are
00:09:56.480 moving across cross borders um foreign
00:10:00.240 Banks or credit providers can use those
00:10:02.680 dollars themselves as collateral and
00:10:04.640 they can lend against them they can
00:10:05.839 multiply that so uh movements of Reserve
00:10:10.399 currencies if you like can be very
00:10:12.399 important in that equation of actually
00:10:13.880 creating liquidity uh I mentioned
00:10:16.120 earlier FX swaps FX swaps are another
00:10:18.880 way of creating liquidity and that's
00:10:21.240 just effectively you know swapping out
00:10:23.000 of one currency into another currency uh
00:10:25.680 but if you're again using the dollar as
00:10:28.360 one of the current one of the currencies
00:10:29.920 in that cross then that dollar can be
00:10:32.200 used as collateral that can be
00:10:33.600 multiplied further so it becomes complex
00:10:37.360 but it's very important to bring that
00:10:38.800 that that side in now if you look at the
00:10:41.600 evolution of the global monetary system
00:10:44.519 and we go back probably 10 15 years the
00:10:47.399 euro dollar markets were very important
00:10:49.279 in terms of creating uh credit uh
00:10:52.000 outside of maybe what the Federal
00:10:53.480 Reserve was doing and think of the euro
00:10:55.720 dollar markets as an independent pool of
00:10:57.720 dollars that uh that Banks worldwide
00:11:00.680 could dip into to actually create Credit
00:11:03.320 Now that pool of Euro dollars has shrunk
00:11:06.560 significantly in the last uh 10 or 15
00:11:09.200 years largely because of increasing
00:11:11.600 controls uh from the US Federal Reserve
00:11:14.079 and the US Treasury uh so the euro
00:11:16.320 dollar market although we don't really
00:11:17.600 know the true size of it hasn't really
00:11:19.920 expanded in 15 years it's still around
00:11:22.680 about Circa $15 trillion from uh
00:11:25.040 according to bis estimates yeah it has
00:11:27.560 to be really hard to uh meure meas the
00:11:30.399 crossb flows um is this maybe the reason
00:11:33.160 some people leave it out of the global
00:11:34.839 liquidity and how do you measure these
00:11:37.360 flows well I mean the way we we do it
00:11:40.240 through uh we we do a lot of data
00:11:42.680 collection and we we're uh looking and
00:11:45.560 talking to uh central banks and
00:11:47.519 financial systems around the world so we
00:11:49.279 we piece these flows together so we've
00:11:51.519 got an idea of the size of crossb Flows
00:11:53.839 In in the markets now where that where
00:11:57.000 those crossb flows really matter uh
00:11:59.839 tends to be when you're thinking about
00:12:01.360 Emerging Market investment because flows
00:12:04.160 of money into Emerging Markets tend to
00:12:06.120 be huge drivers of their financial
00:12:08.240 systems and if you start to see uh
00:12:10.680 liquidity via crossb Capital moving into
00:12:14.120 say Asian Emerging Markets then what
00:12:16.560 will happen is the uh the local central
00:12:18.920 banks will monetize those inflows for
00:12:21.279 the simple reason they don't want their
00:12:22.560 currencies to rise so they'll print
00:12:24.480 money at the same time in other words
00:12:26.480 and that will create a huge domestic
00:12:28.560 credit expansion
00:12:30.079 and that's one of the things we may be
00:12:32.480 about to see looking forward because
00:12:34.680 what we're seeing now is a falling
00:12:36.079 dollar and it may well be that those uh
00:12:38.760 that that's reflecting of money moving
00:12:41.120 outside of the US again yeah so um good
00:12:44.560 that you say moving dollar so maybe
00:12:46.279 let's talk a bit about the US Federal
00:12:47.959 Reserve so um if I understand it
00:12:50.839 correctly so we currently live in a
00:12:52.639 world where we have a lot of outstanding
00:12:54.600 debt and to be able to refinance this
00:12:56.959 debt we need to R roll that over with
00:12:59.240 new Dept um and you already said as well
00:13:02.440 so the balance sheet capacity is more
00:13:04.360 important than the interest rates but
00:13:06.839 the thing is so right now I think it was
00:13:09.160 a couple of days ago the FED cut their
00:13:11.240 interest rates by 50 basis points so how
00:13:13.760 will this affect global liquidity will
00:13:16.240 it affect it or is is that not that as
00:13:19.440 important well I think it's a it's an
00:13:21.680 interesting philosophical point I mean
00:13:23.680 the the thing is that is that interest
00:13:25.680 rate Cuts per se don't necessarily
00:13:27.680 increase liquidity um uh in actual fact
00:13:31.120 I mean one of the paradoxes of recent
00:13:33.240 years would be to say that actually
00:13:35.560 increasing interest rates uh may be uh a
00:13:38.880 greater source of demand in the world
00:13:40.639 economy ironically and the reason for
00:13:42.839 that is is that governments have G now
00:13:44.760 got so much debt they're sitting on so
00:13:46.680 much debt that if their interest bill
00:13:48.680 goes up that's clearly a transfer
00:13:50.320 payment uh to the private sector so
00:13:52.959 another words if I'm holding a
00:13:54.440 Government Bond and interest rates go up
00:13:56.160 I'm going to get more income so you've
00:13:58.240 got to start thinking carefully about
00:14:00.040 maybe how the financial system has
00:14:01.639 changed where there's so much debt
00:14:03.480 around and it may well be paradoxically
00:14:06.120 now that actually if interest rates are
00:14:08.600 being cut it's actually reducing demand
00:14:10.839 in the world economy that may be a
00:14:12.320 paradox but it's worth speculating on
00:14:14.839 that now to come back to why interest
00:14:17.839 rates are less important and maybe why
00:14:19.800 liquidity is more important which I
00:14:21.279 think is a key point for everybody to
00:14:23.480 understand because it's not the normal
00:14:24.920 textbook view generally if you pick up
00:14:27.600 an economics or a finance text book uh
00:14:30.320 it will tell you that uh interest rates
00:14:32.720 are what matter interest rates govern uh
00:14:36.079 the cycle of capital investment and
00:14:38.199 using a sort of traditional Keynesian
00:14:39.880 model uh if Capital spending goes up or
00:14:42.399 comes down it's multiplied through to a
00:14:44.759 bigger increase in GDP and that's what
00:14:46.720 creates growth and we sit on or we sit
00:14:49.880 uh looking at a 9 to 10 year business
00:14:51.880 cycle which is really that capital
00:14:53.519 investment cycle and behind all that
00:14:56.320 Capital markets stand as
00:14:59.560 uh New Capital raising mechanisms now in
00:15:02.160 all those counts the world is different
00:15:04.560 okay uh there's not a great deal of
00:15:06.600 capital spending going on or if there is
00:15:08.680 capital spending going on it's operating
00:15:10.399 in China uh which doesn't operate along
00:15:12.680 these lines is is effectively the state
00:15:14.560 is allocating money for capex um so
00:15:18.040 that's Point number one point number two
00:15:20.399 is that uh against that backdrop of not
00:15:23.279 much Capital spending going on what
00:15:25.639 financial markets are doing more and
00:15:27.160 more of is actually refin ing or rolling
00:15:30.000 over existing debts in the world economy
00:15:33.000 right now there's something like $350
00:15:35.240 trillion of outstanding debts private
00:15:38.079 and public and those debts have to be
00:15:40.720 repaid at some stage and on average they
00:15:43.519 have a maturity of about 5 years which
00:15:45.839 means that you've got on average $70
00:15:48.360 trillion to refinance or roll over every
00:15:51.880 year on average now some years it may be
00:15:54.600 30 some years it may be 60 some years it
00:15:58.079 may be 100 so that's not evenly
00:16:00.319 distributed and one of the things you
00:16:01.959 will hear people talking about in
00:16:03.720 markets even right now is the thought
00:16:06.240 about the maturity wall and the maturity
00:16:08.720 wall basically is represents the fact
00:16:12.079 that uh over the last few years in a low
00:16:14.720 interest rate environment a lot of
00:16:16.680 Corporations have refinanced their debt
00:16:19.440 uh opportunistically with low interest
00:16:21.880 rates and much of that is maturing
00:16:24.040 around 2026 so what you've got is a
00:16:26.639 maturity wall uh which has been very low
00:16:29.240 for the last 2 years but it's really
00:16:30.639 starting to emerge again uh around uh in
00:16:33.480 around two years time now the reason
00:16:36.360 these things are very important is that
00:16:38.319 if you got these debt roles to undertake
00:16:40.800 on average $70 trillion a year you need
00:16:43.480 balance sheet capacity to do that and
00:16:46.079 balance sheet capacity in the financial
00:16:48.360 sector is liquidity I mean that's really
00:16:50.720 what it is so you need liquidity in the
00:16:52.959 system and what you tend to find if you
00:16:54.920 look over the long term uh is that there
00:16:58.160 is a long run ratio uh constant ratio
00:17:01.440 between the amount of debt in the system
00:17:03.360 and the amount of liquidity and if you
00:17:05.400 start to see debt Rising relative to
00:17:08.240 liquidity you risk refinancing problems
00:17:11.919 and if you get refinancing problems you
00:17:13.919 get financial crisis and every financial
00:17:17.000 crisis that you can think of going back
00:17:18.640 over the past few decades has
00:17:20.359 fundamentally been a refinancing crisis
00:17:22.280 think of 2008 uh think of the Asian
00:17:25.079 financial crisis in 97 uh think of the
00:17:28.039 US repo crisis in 2019 all examples of
00:17:31.600 refinancing crisis so you need liquidity
00:17:34.600 so the whole idea that central banks can
00:17:37.520 undertake um QT um you know forever is
00:17:42.160 completely fanciful they've got to come
00:17:44.160 back and they've got to expand their
00:17:45.440 balance sheets and that's what we're
00:17:47.160 beginning to see again now yeah but so
00:17:49.400 currently the FED is still in QT and
00:17:51.840 when will they move towards quantitative
00:17:53.760 easing well the the fed the FED in
00:17:56.760 theory um is do doing QT on paper um
00:18:01.919 there's a difference between in practice
00:18:04.520 uh and on paper and although they say
00:18:07.360 that they are doing QT what they Define
00:18:10.520 now as QT is basically reducing the
00:18:13.159 headline size of the balance sheet
00:18:16.159 now prior to their QT exercise they used
00:18:20.159 to define QE as expansions of liquidity
00:18:23.799 not as expansions in the size of the
00:18:25.320 balance sheet so they've changed the
00:18:27.120 definitions very subtly to own advantage
00:18:30.120 and if you look within the balance sheet
00:18:32.400 and you look at the liquidity creating
00:18:34.360 elements of the balance sheet you'll
00:18:36.240 find that since late
00:18:38.840 2022 uh so almost what two years ago
00:18:42.039 they have been expanding liquidity into
00:18:44.360 US financial markets and how does this
00:18:47.600 quantitative easing work in reality is
00:18:49.919 it because some people just say it's
00:18:51.559 money printing but how does this work uh
00:18:53.760 in general well it it is money printing
00:18:57.360 um in a yes now they creating I mean any
00:19:00.520 way that you're creating credit uh in a
00:19:03.360 credit money economy is effectively
00:19:05.200 printing money so yeah sure they can't
00:19:07.200 deny they're doing that the question is
00:19:08.760 what's the scale of it and I think what
00:19:10.520 you've got to understand or people have
00:19:11.960 got to understand is the way that uh
00:19:14.960 let's say the the landscape of the
00:19:17.360 financial system has changed radically
00:19:19.919 uh in the last few years now partly
00:19:22.480 that's uh about the Federal Reserve and
00:19:24.960 about the central banks and partly it's
00:19:27.000 about the governments and the finance
00:19:29.559 Ministries or the treasur is how they
00:19:31.080 operate and let me fix on the US not
00:19:33.799 because the US is necessarily the bad
00:19:35.600 guy but because the US is very
00:19:37.520 transparent uh it's a big economy and
00:19:39.559 it's actually very easy to understand
00:19:41.919 and if you look at the Federal Reserve
00:19:43.840 first of all the Federal Reserve as I
00:19:45.720 said since late 2022 has been expanding
00:19:48.840 liquidity in the system and it's
00:19:50.840 basically done that through increasing
00:19:53.720 elements on the balance sheet that
00:19:55.480 obviously create liquidity but by
00:19:57.320 definition things like fed credit so Fed
00:20:00.200 Credit into the system is increased and
00:20:02.679 the withdrawals that come that the
00:20:05.200 Federal Reserve or the treasury make
00:20:06.760 from the money markets have declined now
00:20:09.760 uh what people would tend to look at or
00:20:11.679 what what we look at and this goes back
00:20:14.240 a lot to uh the time I was at Salomon
00:20:16.600 brothers and Salomon Brothers put a lot
00:20:18.440 of effort into fed watching uh you know
00:20:20.720 back in the 80s and 90s and whatever and
00:20:23.520 the way that we used to look at the
00:20:24.720 Federal Reserve was basically to look at
00:20:27.360 uh elements on the asset side of the
00:20:29.440 balance sheet like Fed Credit you would
00:20:31.520 have to add to that any operating losses
00:20:33.919 that the Federal Reserve is making
00:20:35.600 because that's effectively uh giving
00:20:37.480 money to the banks uh and on top of that
00:20:40.600 you would subtract um things like the
00:20:43.520 treasury general account uh which is
00:20:45.840 basically a withdrawal of cash uh out of
00:20:48.600 the money markets by the US Treasury the
00:20:50.640 US Treasury builds up its bank deposit
00:20:52.840 account effectively at the fed and
00:20:54.960 that's taking money out of circulation
00:20:57.159 or new fangled things
00:20:59.320 uh you know like um reverse repos and
00:21:02.480 reverse repos are a slightly wonkish
00:21:04.280 concept but it's basically uh again uh
00:21:07.400 what's happening is the Federal Reserve
00:21:08.799 in this case is taking money out of the
00:21:10.480 system and supplying very short-term uh
00:21:13.120 paper to the market in return for that
00:21:15.320 so these are the these are the
00:21:16.919 technicalities but if you look at that
00:21:19.000 equation of fed liquidity fed liquidity
00:21:21.480 is expanded pretty consistently since
00:21:23.880 late
00:21:24.919 2022 uh and it's going to go up more
00:21:27.799 because in the next few months uh we are
00:21:30.360 heading towards the re-imposition of the
00:21:32.240 debt ceiling in the US and that debt
00:21:34.559 ceiling as part of its requirement uh is
00:21:36.919 that the treasury general account is
00:21:38.360 actually paired down to quite low levels
00:21:40.600 low operating levels so there's more fed
00:21:43.360 liquidity likely coming so if you look
00:21:45.360 at the Federal Reserve the Federal
00:21:46.559 Reserve is clearly doing what I would
00:21:48.440 describe as not qeqe okay uh so they say
00:21:52.679 that they say they're doing a QT but
00:21:54.200 that's only their own definition uh it's
00:21:56.320 basically disguise QE and that's going
00:21:58.000 to continue
00:21:59.880 the second thing to look at is what the
00:22:01.600 treasury is doing and the treasury's
00:22:03.320 been particularly clever and Janet
00:22:05.000 Yellen at the treasury has you know one
00:22:07.480 one my Applause in terms of what she's
00:22:09.159 done because what they've managed to do
00:22:11.320 very cleverly is to change the structure
00:22:14.159 of funding for the US government there's
00:22:16.720 an increasing uh proportion of funding
00:22:19.400 which is now done through treasury bills
00:22:21.559 a treasury bill is an instrument of
00:22:23.960 government security uh of up to one year
00:22:26.520 maturity it pays no coupon uh but it's
00:22:29.279 basically uh it's uh sold beneath par
00:22:32.240 and redeemed at par uh a treasury bill
00:22:35.600 now or treasury bills now account for
00:22:37.120 about 22% of total US debt the other
00:22:40.000 thing they've done very cleverly and
00:22:41.559 without very much commentary in fact is
00:22:43.960 that they have um uh reduced the average
00:22:47.600 maturity of bonds sold at their uh uh
00:22:51.760 through the calendar when the treasury
00:22:54.480 comes to the market and issues
00:22:56.279 government debt the average tenor of
00:22:58.559 that debt has dropped by about 1.2 years
00:23:02.360 since the end of 2022 now in fixed
00:23:04.760 income terms that's quite a big drop so
00:23:06.760 in other words to put it in granular
00:23:08.520 terms they're no longer issuing 10year
00:23:10.799 bonds or 20year bonds or 30-year bonds
00:23:13.240 they're issuing bonds much uh closer to
00:23:16.159 2 years 3 years 5 years s years so the
00:23:19.000 whole uh focus of treasur issuances
00:23:22.520 changed or shifted in maturity from the
00:23:24.640 long end towards the short end of the
00:23:26.159 market now why is that important you ask
00:23:28.960 comes back to your point about
00:23:30.120 monetization printing money because who
00:23:33.600 tends to buy long-dated uh debt in the
00:23:36.320 markets in other words 20- year or
00:23:38.240 30-year bonds it tends to be Pension
00:23:40.000 funds or life insurance funds and those
00:23:43.320 funds are simply dipping into existing
00:23:45.400 savings so it's just a reallocation of
00:23:47.760 savings from one pot to another it is
00:23:50.279 not monetization it's purely uh a direct
00:23:52.799 funding out of existing savings so
00:23:54.440 there's no problem with that or the or
00:23:57.559 the only problem could be is that if
00:23:59.159 there's not the appetite for bonds
00:24:00.559 interest rates will clearly go up if you
00:24:02.840 fund at the short end of the market uh
00:24:05.240 in other words through bills or
00:24:06.520 short-dated bonds it tends to be the
00:24:09.279 banks or the credit providers that buy
00:24:11.520 those uh those instruments and the
00:24:14.000 reason being is if you think about what
00:24:15.720 happens when the government is running a
00:24:17.679 deficit if the government's running a
00:24:19.640 deficit and let's say it's because uh
00:24:22.200 I'm the government and I'm paying you as
00:24:23.760 a government worker and you put the
00:24:25.559 money in your bank account the bank's
00:24:27.440 balance sheet will be misalign because
00:24:30.080 it's received a deposit and the deposits
00:24:32.720 or the its liabilities now exceed its
00:24:35.279 assets so it's got to find a matching
00:24:37.200 asset for that deposit and what better
00:24:39.480 than a short-term government debt uh
00:24:41.760 like a bill or a short-dated bond and
00:24:44.039 that's exactly what happens now the
00:24:45.919 difference between these two cases which
00:24:47.919 as I say may be somewhat Arcane or
00:24:49.640 wonkish is the fact that in the pension
00:24:52.399 fund example bank's balance sheets
00:24:54.039 didn't increase in the second example
00:24:56.559 they've increased and any in increase in
00:24:59.080 bank balance sheets or credit providers
00:25:01.240 balance sheets is a liquidity expansion
00:25:03.399 and that's a monetization and this is
00:25:05.840 what's happening in the US if you look
00:25:07.480 at this year something like to go back
00:25:09.240 to your uh your statistic of M2 uh M2 as
00:25:12.919 it say is measuring High Street Banks
00:25:14.960 balance sheets but if you look at M2 for
00:25:17.000 example uh about 34s of the increase in
00:25:19.720 M2 this year has been through direct
00:25:21.960 monetization of of the government
00:25:24.159 deficit big number and then the only
00:25:26.880 thing I don't understand in that is how
00:25:29.000 can this refining system continue to
00:25:31.320 survive in the long term uh are the
00:25:33.679 policy makers hoping on AI or some
00:25:35.799 technical advancements or will we just
00:25:37.600 live the next decade with uh higher than
00:25:39.799 normal
00:25:41.320 inflation well I think that's the
00:25:43.200 $664,000 question um Can the politicians
00:25:46.520 keep kicking the can down the road and I
00:25:49.240 think the examples you know from history
00:25:51.799 um are enlightening but maybe not very
00:25:54.200 encouraging and if you look at the the
00:25:56.559 two instances or actually there are
00:25:58.520 three instances I could site of big debt
00:26:01.720 increases okay now the first of those
00:26:04.840 came after the Napoleon Wars and the
00:26:08.200 British economy saw a big increase in
00:26:10.320 its debt public debt uh to pay for the
00:26:13.520 wars against Napoleon in Europe and that
00:26:16.320 caused the debt GDP ratio for the UK to
00:26:19.159 Skyrocket now that period um in the the
00:26:23.600 subsequent period saw the debt GDP ratio
00:26:26.799 of the UK come down quite appreciably
00:26:29.440 but you got to remember what was the
00:26:30.640 background the background was the
00:26:31.840 Industrial Revolution and productivity
00:26:34.120 gains were huge now you could e you
00:26:36.679 could also say that that wasn't a
00:26:38.520 particularly comfortable period for
00:26:40.080 people uh that were in the working class
00:26:42.320 to actually live because they had to
00:26:44.000 work you know uh long long hours under
00:26:46.919 terrible conditions but there was a big
00:26:48.960 increase in productivity in the UK
00:26:50.559 economy and the debt GDP ratio came down
00:26:53.480 so park that thought the other two
00:26:55.640 examples basically come uh immediately
00:26:58.039 after World War II again featuring the
00:26:59.760 British economy where the debt GDP ratio
00:27:02.760 was again Sky High um through the 19
00:27:05.760 late 1940s and 1950s but it did come
00:27:08.120 down now that period uh for the British
00:27:11.440 economy wasn't a particularly great one
00:27:13.120 in factual fact the subsequent decades
00:27:14.880 have not been great the British economy
00:27:16.720 has never come back to its former uh
00:27:19.080 strength uh because of that big debt
00:27:21.240 burden and it was only really reduced
00:27:23.760 because of a baby boom uh in the postwar
00:27:26.720 years which actually led to uh faster
00:27:29.159 GDP so that was another way of uh of
00:27:32.159 sort of getting debt down and a lot of
00:27:34.080 the welfare systems that were then
00:27:35.880 enacted uh by the British government and
00:27:38.279 other governments were payers you go
00:27:39.919 systems so they depended on the young
00:27:42.760 workers uh effectively paying in uh and
00:27:45.720 they could offset uh any older workers
00:27:47.880 that are retiring or needed welfare
00:27:49.399 benefits the trouble is that equation
00:27:51.240 has now gone dramatically the other way
00:27:54.000 so you haven't got young workers coming
00:27:55.480 in you got a lot of older people needing
00:27:57.320 welfare third example is Japan and Japan
00:28:00.559 has got sky high debt GDP ratios uh but
00:28:04.559 again you know the Japanese economy is
00:28:07.000 is suffering Japan uh is not like uh it
00:28:10.240 was in the 1980s it's not seeing big
00:28:12.159 productivity gains it's an old aging
00:28:14.480 Society it's suffering from uh you know
00:28:17.159 bounce of deflation from time to time
00:28:19.360 and although the Japanese standard of
00:28:20.720 living is is pretty decent uh it's
00:28:23.360 certainly not advancing it's being
00:28:24.960 caught up by a lot of other countries
00:28:26.679 particularly if the yen is weak as it
00:28:28.600 has been in the last um year or so so
00:28:31.080 you've got these examples of saying that
00:28:33.919 economies can survive uh with high debt
00:28:36.760 to GDP ratios uh you know the Japanese
00:28:39.200 wake up every morning they eat breakfast
00:28:40.919 and whatever and they go to work and
00:28:42.360 everyone seems comfortable but the
00:28:44.000 economic lifestyle has changed these are
00:28:45.720 not Dynamic economies and that's the
00:28:47.799 problem you get when you get large
00:28:49.320 amounts of public sector unproductive
00:28:51.159 debt in an economy growth tends to slow
00:28:54.640 and that's the issue we got to face so
00:28:56.440 it's quite feasible that you could see
00:28:58.600 these high debt GDP ratios persisting
00:29:01.159 for a long time politicians will kick
00:29:03.640 the can down the road because they're
00:29:04.880 never going to tackle them and so what
00:29:06.720 you need to finance these debts is more
00:29:08.760 and more liquidity now as you rightly
00:29:11.000 allude to that liquidity is fungible H
00:29:14.559 it moves in other words and it can spill
00:29:16.600 over into other areas so it can spill
00:29:19.000 over into asset markets which it does do
00:29:21.440 and it drives asset prices higher and it
00:29:23.640 spills over into the High Street and
00:29:25.200 creates inflation now
00:29:28.480 what's the difference between monetary
00:29:30.159 inflation which I've been talking about
00:29:32.519 uh in terms of the expansion of
00:29:34.159 liquidity and High Street inflation
00:29:36.640 which is really what bothers most people
00:29:38.120 when their Consumer Price baskets go up
00:29:40.679 and the answer is there's a close but
00:29:43.000 not exact connection and monetary
00:29:46.559 factors or monetary inflation is an
00:29:48.559 important ingredient into consumer
00:29:51.159 prices but it's not the only Factor so
00:29:53.480 you've got to think about oil prices
00:29:54.840 you've got to think about productivity
00:29:56.600 gains other words techn technology
00:29:58.559 technological advances you got to think
00:30:00.440 about China dump jumping dumping cheap
00:30:02.760 Goods into Western markets uh tax
00:30:05.760 changes oil prices all these things come
00:30:08.360 into the consumer basket but they're not
00:30:10.320 about monetary inflation so monetary
00:30:12.760 inflation uh in the last 20 years has
00:30:15.799 been quite substantial but High Street
00:30:18.080 inflation has been very low and that's
00:30:19.880 because you've seen by definition cost
00:30:22.519 deflation through these other factors
00:30:24.519 now the question to ask is looking
00:30:25.880 forward 20 years are we going to see the
00:30:28.279 same degree of cost deflation well maybe
00:30:31.279 but that's a projection and I would be
00:30:33.720 skeptical or we're going to see the same
00:30:35.120 amount but you know may be willingly or
00:30:37.399 happily surprised in the in the event
00:30:39.360 but who knows but you have got a lot of
00:30:41.279 monetary inflation and monetary
00:30:42.960 inflation seems to be running on at a
00:30:45.120 rate of something like 8 to 10% per anom
00:30:47.919 which really means that the stock of
00:30:50.399 liquidity is doubling within 10 years
00:30:53.799 every 10 years so what that basically
00:30:56.360 means is that uh if you start to think
00:30:58.880 about asset markets if asset markets
00:31:01.399 need to keep Pace with monetary
00:31:02.919 inflation they've got to double as well
00:31:04.799 every 10 years so what are the assets
00:31:06.760 you need to own Now spoiler alert gold
00:31:11.240 has always been a very good monetary
00:31:13.279 inflation hedge and if you look back
00:31:16.080 since year
00:31:17.440 2000 um the stock of US Government debt
00:31:21.320 federal debt has increased Eightfold 80
00:31:25.320 fold since year 2000
00:31:28.120 the price of gold bullion has increased
00:31:30.360 by about 8 and a half times since year
00:31:32.760 2000 so gold has been a great hedge now
00:31:35.080 we know Bitcoin has actually done even
00:31:37.600 better than that but that may be sort of
00:31:39.799 an unfair statistic because Bitcoin is
00:31:42.679 there's new take up as well coming into
00:31:44.279 Bitcoin but you want to think seriously
00:31:47.080 away from the traditional 6040 asset
00:31:50.159 allocation mix with 60 Equity 40 bonds
00:31:53.480 because that is not going to work in a
00:31:55.919 world where you've got monetary
00:31:57.240 inflation you need to diversify the
00:31:59.960 40% uh that's in bonds into lots of
00:32:02.760 other areas you got to think about gold
00:32:05.240 you got to think about cryptocurrencies
00:32:07.399 you've got to think about um treasury
00:32:09.600 inflation protected securities in other
00:32:11.559 words index link bonds you got to think
00:32:13.519 about prime residential real estate you
00:32:15.519 may even think about
00:32:17.080 Commodities great answer so to recap so
00:32:20.440 you actually don't think the FED will be
00:32:22.039 able to keep its 2% Targets in the
00:32:24.960 future no I don't think I think that's
00:32:28.600 right but I think the the reality is if
00:32:30.840 you start to drill down into the data um
00:32:34.279 the underlying inflation rate in the US
00:32:37.279 or the way the market is envisioning
00:32:39.880 long-term inflation is not the 2% that
00:32:41.880 is represented as Break Even inflation
00:32:44.840 in the bond markets I think it's much
00:32:46.880 higher than that already I think it's
00:32:48.039 nearer 3 and a half% and the reason that
00:32:50.320 you can get to that figure is that the
00:32:53.159 treasury as I said is sort of fiddling
00:32:55.440 the cards here because they're doing a
00:32:57.120 lot of issuance at the short end of the
00:32:59.679 market because they're issuing at the
00:33:01.720 short end of the market they are
00:33:03.360 starving institutions like Pension funds
00:33:06.039 and life insurance funds of long C long
00:33:08.519 dated coupon Bonds in other words 10
00:33:10.639 year and 20e treasuries so the price of
00:33:14.880 those bonds is artificially inflated and
00:33:17.799 so if you look at the yields which is
00:33:19.799 the inverse of the price of a bond at
00:33:22.240 the 10-year tener uh it's probably about
00:33:25.159 100 to 150 basis points lower than it
00:33:28.000 should be okay and you can work you can
00:33:30.320 look at these calculations
00:33:31.399 mathematically it's something we do and
00:33:34.000 that is the Distortion that's being
00:33:35.519 caused by what the treasury in the US is
00:33:37.799 doing now if you hold that thought and
00:33:39.840 you say well actually uh therefore uh if
00:33:43.120 the conventional bond is 100 to 150
00:33:45.639 basis points uh lower in yield than it
00:33:48.440 really should be because of their
00:33:50.159 Shenanigans if we factored uh a true
00:33:53.200 bond yield in um that is probably nearer
00:33:56.440 52% and look at the real yield on tips
00:33:59.919 then the break even inflation rate is
00:34:01.720 not the 2% that's advertised it's near a
00:34:04.159 3 and a half% and that's what I think
00:34:06.399 the Bond markets are really telling us
00:34:08.159 now that inflation is higher now the
00:34:10.280 Federal Reserve is never going to change
00:34:11.480 its 2% Target but that would be Madness
00:34:13.800 from their point of view they're going
00:34:15.040 to keep the you know keep up the pretend
00:34:18.280 yeah all right so um this was a federal
00:34:21.639 reserve so now the the second most
00:34:23.599 important driver as you said is the pboc
00:34:25.599 The People's Bank of China so uh could
00:34:27.960 you explain what happened last week in
00:34:29.399 China because I saw they cut their
00:34:31.239 interest rates and I even saw today they
00:34:33.760 were injecting a lot of liquidity I
00:34:36.239 think it was 1 trillion youan uh to Big
00:34:38.960 Banks so can you explain what what's
00:34:40.879 happening there yeah okay it's um I
00:34:43.839 think one's got to sort of start at the
00:34:45.560 beginning with China because it's a it's
00:34:46.918 a complicated
00:34:48.359 situation uh the short answer is that as
00:34:52.079 regarding the uh interventions that the
00:34:55.599 People's Bank and the government have
00:34:57.119 made in the last last few days it's
00:34:59.079 really too early to say and to judge uh
00:35:02.160 what they're doing and what effect it
00:35:03.359 will have uh I know a lot of
00:35:05.240 commentators have sort of jumped up and
00:35:06.880 said you know this means X this means y
00:35:09.040 i there's no way they can tell in
00:35:10.680 honesty uh it's it's it's purely for the
00:35:13.400 cameras um the the problem that China's
00:35:17.440 got is twofold one is a cyclical problem
00:35:19.760 one is a secular
00:35:21.280 problem the secular problem is that
00:35:23.680 basically uh red capitalism if that's
00:35:26.280 the way you can describe it the Chinese
00:35:28.599 economic model does not work unless the
00:35:31.119 West accommodates it okay because
00:35:34.000 basically uh what China has needed is
00:35:37.320 use of the dollar uh it's effectively a
00:35:39.760 dollarized economy and also it needs
00:35:43.040 access to Western markets and if the
00:35:45.119 West makes it difficult for China to use
00:35:46.920 the dollar and it basically puts tariffs
00:35:49.560 or controls up to stop China dumping
00:35:51.760 Goods than the Chinese economic model uh
00:35:53.960 Founders and that's exactly what's been
00:35:55.720 going on so China's found it very very
00:35:57.880 very difficult to uh continue to grow
00:36:00.240 along
00:36:01.839 Trend that will be something that is not
00:36:04.440 going to be easily resolved it's not in
00:36:06.160 the gift of China uh it's really in the
00:36:08.319 gift of the west or the the world
00:36:10.440 economy I would say and it will not be
00:36:12.079 resolved overnight but it was something
00:36:13.920 will emerge over coming years as to how
00:36:17.119 that that uh that circle is squared the
00:36:19.920 cyclical issue is a different question
00:36:22.520 as well maybe it's connected but it's
00:36:25.319 really a different uh different problem
00:36:27.920 that is that the Chinese economy went
00:36:30.079 into
00:36:31.440 lockdown uh rather like everybody else
00:36:33.720 through covid but the Chinese econom has
00:36:36.319 never emerged from that lockdown because
00:36:38.680 the Chinese uh People's Bank has never
00:36:40.839 been able to ease monetary policy to
00:36:42.920 lift the economy out again and the
00:36:45.040 reason for that was that a target of the
00:36:47.680 Chinese uh Administration has been to
00:36:50.640 keep the Yuan the Chinese currency the
00:36:53.280 RB if you like uh firm against the US
00:36:56.480 dollar and the US dollar has been quite
00:36:58.920 strong through this period what's more
00:37:01.280 the Yen has collapsed and that's put uh
00:37:04.040 a lot of pressure downward pressure on
00:37:06.119 the Chinese currency and so what the
00:37:08.119 Chinese have been doing through this
00:37:09.520 period has been tightening monetary
00:37:11.000 policy just at the time when they
00:37:12.800 shouldn't be doing that and so the
00:37:14.960 result is that uh the Yuan has been held
00:37:17.560 up but the economy is basically uh been
00:37:20.599 pushed down and that backdrop is one
00:37:23.280 which has basically caused deflation now
00:37:25.839 another way to think about this is to is
00:37:27.720 to think in terms of China overproducing
00:37:30.920 Goods which is doing this is the red
00:37:33.839 capitalism model if you like China
00:37:35.960 produces a lot but doesn't consume very
00:37:37.880 much so the excess production is
00:37:40.000 basically sold into the world economy
00:37:42.400 now from an economics point of view what
00:37:44.160 that means is that if there is that
00:37:45.880 Surplus
00:37:47.240 existing markets should operate to
00:37:50.000 eliminate the Sur Surplus by pushing
00:37:52.839 down the real exchange rate in other
00:37:54.440 words the exchange rate adjusted for uh
00:37:56.800 relative price
00:37:58.520 and either China's nominal exchange rate
00:38:01.640 Falls to clear the market or prices in
00:38:04.599 China fall okay now what I've just been
00:38:07.280 saying is that the Chinese have gone to
00:38:09.240 Great Lengths to hold the currency up so
00:38:11.920 by holding the currency up in the face
00:38:13.560 of the excess production it means they
00:38:15.920 put all the pressure on adjustment on
00:38:20.240 prices in both the High Street and in
00:38:22.319 asset markets and consequently what
00:38:24.400 you've been seeing in China is deflation
00:38:26.640 in both markets
00:38:28.119 now the question the Chinese got to have
00:38:29.760 got to make is well okay we're looking
00:38:32.319 at this adjustment process we already
00:38:33.839 really just started it and if they're
00:38:36.160 insistent on keeping the Yuan up you're
00:38:39.079 going to likely to see much much greater
00:38:41.520 deflation in the Chinese economy now
00:38:43.760 that is impossible because no economy
00:38:45.560 can really stand that degree of
00:38:47.040 deflation without falling apart so the
00:38:49.240 Chinese really have to do something and
00:38:52.040 my view is that they've really got uh a
00:38:54.400 number of choices choice number one is
00:38:57.040 that they somehow Chang their economic
00:38:58.680 model that's really the the structural
00:39:00.359 argument we were talking about earlier
00:39:01.560 on that they're not want to do that
00:39:03.680 overnight the second thing is that they
00:39:05.680 could basically boost the economy with
00:39:07.280 monetary policy uh and forget about the
00:39:10.400 uan exchange rate um and allow the Yuan
00:39:13.880 to devalue significantly that is the
00:39:16.160 most likely long-term Outlook in my view
00:39:19.000 so we're looking at a significantly
00:39:20.760 weaker uan and just for the record if
00:39:23.520 you look at what happened in Japan in
00:39:25.599 the 1980s in Korea and Taiwan in the
00:39:29.280 late ' 80s early '90s in the other Asian
00:39:32.119 economies in the late 1990s and
00:39:34.680 Scandinavia around the early 90s these
00:39:36.920 are all examples of countries that
00:39:39.560 basically saw asset Bubbles and
00:39:41.359 overvalued real exchange rates and every
00:39:44.040 single uh problem was ultimately
00:39:46.160 resolved by currency collapse so China
00:39:48.480 is no different here it's it's got to go
00:39:50.599 down that same road now there is a a a
00:39:53.920 short-term alternative and the
00:39:55.920 short-term alternative is that rather
00:39:58.440 than um the Chinese uh devaluing um the
00:40:03.520 dollar could fall significantly and that
00:40:05.680 would give the Chinese some uh some room
00:40:09.319 for
00:40:10.319 maneuver and it may be that there's a
00:40:12.400 deal which has been done and one of the
00:40:14.319 things that we've been arguing for the
00:40:15.680 last few months is that it looks as if
00:40:17.920 um the there's been an agreement between
00:40:20.280 the Chinese uh the Japanese and the
00:40:23.079 Americans to basically allow the US
00:40:25.280 dollar to fall a bit not dramatically
00:40:27.480 but fall a bit and that is being uh
00:40:29.880 driven by us monetary policy easing now
00:40:34.040 it so happened that in the wake of the
00:40:35.839 US monetary policy announcement of
00:40:38.079 easing by the Federal Reserve uh within
00:40:40.760 about a week or so of that the Chinese
00:40:42.400 have announced this polic eing so they
00:40:44.680 always say in financial markets there
00:40:46.200 are no unconnected events uh unrelated
00:40:48.920 events and this is an example of that
00:40:50.720 the Japanese have voiced or they said at
00:40:53.520 the beginning of August which is why the
00:40:55.000 Yen jumped up um they were going to
00:40:57.599 tighten monetary policy well forget that
00:40:59.359 there's no way the Japanese could
00:41:01.160 tighten monetary policy they can't raise
00:41:02.920 interest rates their debt burden is so
00:41:05.200 big they would just compound their debt
00:41:06.760 interest payments so they can't do that
00:41:09.040 so realistically the only maneuver could
00:41:11.640 be for the FED to ease the FED may have
00:41:13.920 won some quid pro quo from the Chinese
00:41:18.000 don't know what that is could be
00:41:19.319 connected with Ukraine it could be
00:41:20.560 connected with buying us treasuries in
00:41:22.119 the long term I just don't know but it
00:41:24.240 could be and therefore you're seeing the
00:41:26.599 dollar aggressively coming down and that
00:41:29.480 will give the Chinese a window where
00:41:31.000 they can ease policy and somehow dig
00:41:33.119 themselves out of the mess at least
00:41:34.640 temporarily so that's what I think is
00:41:36.280 going on now can we infer that from the
00:41:39.960 announcement they made two or three days
00:41:42.000 ago no not at all because they were
00:41:44.400 talking about you know minor minor
00:41:46.319 changes of interest rates of a few basis
00:41:48.200 points uh they were talking about you
00:41:50.160 know letting the banks have an extra
00:41:52.160 trillion dollars by uh changing reserve
00:41:54.720 requirements well you know big deal what
00:41:56.640 they should be doing doing here is they
00:41:58.680 don't operate by the way through
00:41:59.880 interest rates they operate through the
00:42:01.680 state allocation of credit it's all
00:42:03.400 about the pboc injecting money into the
00:42:05.960 money markets which the shadow Banks can
00:42:07.880 take up or it's through directives to
00:42:10.480 the state-owned banks and so what we've
00:42:12.640 got to look at to judge this correctly
00:42:15.280 is to look at the course of Japanese uh
00:42:17.079 sorry Chinese Bank lending over the
00:42:19.359 course of the next few months and to
00:42:21.240 look to see how much money The People's
00:42:23.520 Bank of China injects into their money
00:42:25.040 markets but that's something you can't
00:42:26.599 tell on one day basis you could look at
00:42:29.079 over the course of several weeks yeah
00:42:31.960 and another question so we're talking
00:42:34.160 about uh China and pboc so um China will
00:42:38.079 expend its liquidity and my question was
00:42:41.040 uh so we're going to talk about Bitcoin
00:42:42.599 later in the video but um do you think
00:42:45.559 the Chinese ban on bitcoin uh affects it
00:42:48.920 will the expansion in liquidity still
00:42:50.520 have an effect on bitcoin although it's
00:42:52.040 ban in China I'm not sure if you have
00:42:54.040 the answer but I was thinking well I
00:42:55.960 think that I don't I don't think the
00:42:57.800 Chinese ban really matters to that
00:42:59.760 extent um but you know the the issue
00:43:03.240 that we're really looking at here is
00:43:04.839 that uh I wouldn't necessarily fix so
00:43:07.599 much on what CH what China is doing with
00:43:10.200 its liquidity in this context uh I'd
00:43:13.079 think about the association that the
00:43:15.119 Federal Reserve is easing and the
00:43:16.839 Federal Reserve is going to have a
00:43:18.119 bigger impact anyway but you know what
00:43:20.599 what tends to matter for things like the
00:43:23.200 price of Bitcoin and for all assets
00:43:25.240 tends to be in general global liquidity
00:43:27.720 not specific country liquidity I know I
00:43:29.880 made the point earlier on that the US
00:43:31.359 tends to the margin tends to be more
00:43:33.119 important for financial assets that's
00:43:35.319 true China tends to be more important
00:43:37.400 for commodity markets that's true but
00:43:39.800 liquidity is fungible so you know we've
00:43:42.720 got to look at the whole picture and
00:43:44.559 it's not just China easing in isolation
00:43:47.319 the US is easing as well the ECB is
00:43:49.760 easing I mean one of the biggest
00:43:51.079 increases in liquidity we've seen this
00:43:53.200 year has come out of the European
00:43:54.559 markets so uh it's not just an isolated
00:43:58.400 event here most central banks something
00:44:00.359 like 70% of central banks now worldwide
00:44:03.720 by number are easing liquidity the super
00:44:06.960 tanker is turning around how much did he
00:44:08.960 say 70% of 70% by number of central
00:44:12.960 banks okay are easing all right so now
00:44:16.440 let's talk Global liquidity effect on
00:44:18.880 asset prices so and I have a quote here
00:44:20.640 from your book so you quoted the ECB in
00:44:22.880 2012 saying measures of liquidity are
00:44:25.680 one of the best performing leading
00:44:27.319 indicators of asset price booms and
00:44:29.280 busts so basically if more Capital flows
00:44:31.839 into the system how does that affect the
00:44:34.400 valuation of equities well quite simply
00:44:37.200 they go up but I mean you you've heard
00:44:38.640 it from the horse's mouth this is what
00:44:40.640 the the policy makers are actually
00:44:42.280 telling us yeah they they're agreeing
00:44:44.280 with this uh it's just the trouble is
00:44:46.520 the academics are you know years and
00:44:48.559 years behind in catching up with this
00:44:50.160 concept and is this because of the
00:44:52.400 debasement of the currency or why is it
00:44:55.520 well I mean you could say it Tim Ely
00:44:57.319 does debase the currency there's no
00:44:58.720 question about that but it's really
00:45:00.400 because if I give you more money you're
00:45:02.000 going to spend it and what do you spend
00:45:03.920 it on well you might buy yourself a new
00:45:05.680 sports car or you might buy you know
00:45:08.559 uh a new suit But ultimately if you got
00:45:11.480 lots of liquidity left over you're going
00:45:13.160 to put it into Financial assets yeah U
00:45:15.520 and it's as simple as that and how come
00:45:17.720 it moves in in
00:45:19.800 Cycles well that's an interesting
00:45:22.240 question I think the question it what it
00:45:24.640 really comes down to I would say is
00:45:27.680 um three different things okay one is
00:45:31.119 that there is uh we must recognize
00:45:33.559 there's a cycle in policy and that cycle
00:45:37.079 in policy could well have political um
00:45:41.760 drivers so it may be that uh you know
00:45:44.599 despite what what is said by the Federal
00:45:46.720 Reserve as being independent or central
00:45:48.280 banks being independent on paper they
00:45:50.640 are influenced by politicians and by the
00:45:52.520 political cycle that may be the case I
00:45:54.880 mean clearly if you look at the Federal
00:45:56.319 Reserve right now now there's been a lot
00:45:57.680 of debate about whether the interest
00:45:59.720 rate cut was political or not whether it
00:46:01.800 was trying to you know help uh Cala
00:46:05.280 Harris become elected so you we we've
00:46:09.200 got to acknowledge that's true the
00:46:11.680 second fact is that liquidity uh if
00:46:15.040 liquidity is in financial markets it's
00:46:16.800 not in the real economy and liquidity
00:46:19.200 can't be in two places at once and so if
00:46:21.359 you got a very strong real economy uh
00:46:24.280 then you're going to get very weak
00:46:26.520 Financial markets because money will be
00:46:28.119 sucked out of the financial sector and
00:46:29.760 equally vice versa so what we're really
00:46:32.359 saying is that if there is uh an
00:46:34.400 economic cycle what you're likely to see
00:46:36.599 as well is that economic cycle being
00:46:38.520 reflected in financial markets so in
00:46:40.800 other words strong economies don't have
00:46:42.839 strong financial markets it tends to be
00:46:44.920 weaker economies have strong financial
00:46:46.800 markets which is the Paradox and then
00:46:48.680 the third thing which is probably the
00:46:49.920 most dominant is about debt rollover so
00:46:53.480 uh I mentioned earlier on about the
00:46:55.079 maturity wall that matur wall U you know
00:46:58.720 is not there this year and it's probably
00:47:00.800 not around very much next year but it's
00:47:03.280 certainly really coming uh in 2026 and
00:47:07.160 that maturity wall will mean that a lot
00:47:09.599 of uh liquidity is likely to be used for
00:47:12.040 debt rollover so that's another use so
00:47:14.520 what you've got is a cycle our view is
00:47:17.160 that the cycle is about six well in fact
00:47:19.920 our estimates are 65 months and that
00:47:23.280 that may seem an overly precise figure
00:47:25.359 but let me explain how we got there
00:47:27.520 uh we did uh what is called technically
00:47:30.040 or mathematically uh furri an analysis
00:47:33.079 which is basically uh sort of fitting
00:47:35.760 Cycles uh you know sine waves if you
00:47:38.119 like to uh to data series and we did an
00:47:41.640 exercise uh back in year 2000 so you
00:47:44.359 know almost 25 years ago now where we
00:47:46.599 basically had our liquidity data going
00:47:48.960 back to 1970 and we fitted a fuer
00:47:51.920 analysis uh to that data series and we
00:47:54.520 came up with uh uh the fact that the
00:47:58.680 cycle is moving with a frequency of
00:48:00.720 about 65 months now we haven't changed
00:48:02.880 it since the year 2000 we've just let
00:48:05.480 those Cycles run on uh but remarkably
00:48:08.280 they capture the bulk of uh of movements
00:48:10.839 of inflections in global liquidity so it
00:48:13.880 seems as if there is a fairly regular
00:48:15.800 pattern now it so happens that that 65
00:48:19.079 Monon uh period on average is the
00:48:21.880 average maturity of debt in the world
00:48:24.880 economy so in other words what this
00:48:27.480 liquidity cycle is dominated by is a
00:48:30.359 debt refinancing cycle and that's how I
00:48:33.839 I would best explain it yeah and so yeah
00:48:36.200 then the thing is um if it's widely
00:48:38.960 known that investors known that the
00:48:40.720 global liquidity moves in Cycles uh
00:48:43.040 doesn't that mean that investors can
00:48:44.680 easily profit from it and doesn't that
00:48:47.119 also mean that efficient markets don't
00:48:50.640 work well you're right I mean well I
00:48:53.880 suppose it's it I think that if you go
00:48:56.839 back to the fact that um you know let
00:49:00.359 let's take your first
00:49:02.000 statement can investors profit from it
00:49:04.960 yes do investors profit from it yes do
00:49:08.280 all investors profit from it no uh
00:49:11.160 because there's a large constituency out
00:49:13.079 there who basically does not believe in
00:49:15.640 the concept of liquidity uh it people
00:49:18.280 say you know it's it's subject to the
00:49:20.839 greater fall Theory um you
00:49:23.440 know why why should why AR markets
00:49:26.880 efficient in the sense of a textbook
00:49:28.839 sense that if we know all this uh you
00:49:31.520 know why is it that uh that that markets
00:49:33.960 still move up now there's an interesting
00:49:36.480 uh you know joke or anecdote which is
00:49:39.440 that you know two economics professors
00:49:41.440 are walking across a lawn in uh in
00:49:43.720 America and one of them spies out of the
00:49:46.480 corner of his eye a $100 bill and he
00:49:49.200 bends down to pick it up and the other
00:49:50.599 professor says don't uh because we're an
00:49:53.160 efficient market world that doesn't
00:49:54.680 exist uh someone else must have picked
00:49:56.480 it up before you and that that's really
00:49:58.920 the you know that I think is explains
00:50:00.920 really what's going on is that you've
00:50:03.119 got to understand that if there's more
00:50:04.599 money in the system people will react to
00:50:06.440 that and uh markets may be great at
00:50:09.119 discounting information but they also
00:50:11.559 respond to liquidity uh and if liquidity
00:50:14.960 is going up more people are going to buy
00:50:17.520 uh if liquidity is going down they're
00:50:19.000 going to be for Sellers and the way that
00:50:20.799 we think about markets is not really
00:50:22.599 from the perspective of individual
00:50:24.680 Securities it's through the mass of
00:50:26.760 investors and we recognize the fact that
00:50:29.440 investors operate via constraints they
00:50:31.839 have liability constraints they've got
00:50:33.440 to they've got to make so for example
00:50:35.280 think of you know your retirement or
00:50:36.760 whatever it may be you've got to have
00:50:38.520 Assets in place that are going to give
00:50:39.960 you an income uh or going to be
00:50:42.760 sufficient worth by the time you retire
00:50:44.920 so you can live uh without working uh
00:50:47.839 and that's clearly a constraint but
00:50:49.319 that's actually dictating your
00:50:51.040 investment patterns so these these
00:50:53.880 factors tend to be more important in our
00:50:55.680 view in terms of understanding financial
00:50:58.240 markets all right and I think this is
00:51:00.760 the question that everybody wants to
00:51:02.319 hear from you so is global liquidity
00:51:04.720 expanding for the moment and um where is
00:51:07.440 it headed in the near future well again
00:51:10.119 I think you've got to differentiate the
00:51:11.359 trend from the cycle uh the cycle
00:51:13.640 bottomed in uh 2022 in late
00:51:17.559 2022 uh that bottoming coincided with
00:51:20.680 the British guilt debacle The sell off
00:51:22.920 in the sovereign debt Market when uh the
00:51:25.839 new Prime Minister enacted a budget
00:51:29.040 prime minister Liz truss came in with a
00:51:31.799 ill-thought out budget uh the sovereign
00:51:34.160 debt Market sold off that was an
00:51:36.160 immediate wakeup call for central banks
00:51:38.400 and treasury ministers worldwide uh the
00:51:40.920 bank of England with alacrity changed
00:51:42.720 from QT to QE uh you know uh overnight
00:51:46.760 pretty much and the Federal Reserve
00:51:49.000 began to change its policy and added
00:51:50.960 more liquidity to markets so at the end
00:51:53.440 of the day you know what this is really
00:51:55.640 telling us is that the despite the
00:51:57.680 remits of central banks uh supposedly
00:52:00.920 against fighting inflation and um
00:52:04.040 employment what their real or true goal
00:52:07.200 is is to preserve the Integrity of
00:52:09.040 sovereign debt markets and that's
00:52:10.880 exactly what happened uh that point the
00:52:13.200 liquidity cycle has been increasing uh
00:52:15.839 from that point uh we think it's likely
00:52:18.240 to Peak out in late 2025 it's still
00:52:21.799 going up now it's exactly on track so
00:52:24.280 there's no question about that the
00:52:26.119 wobble in markets that we saw in August
00:52:28.680 of this year uh at the time when the
00:52:30.559 Japanese Yen spiked was a purely a
00:52:33.160 change in Risk appetite risk exposure as
00:52:35.599 we said at the time there was nothing
00:52:37.640 about deteriorating liquidity conditions
00:52:40.280 uh liquidity has continued to expand and
00:52:42.559 I think the pickup in goal is a test to
00:52:44.680 that so goal is making alltime highs the
00:52:47.079 whole time um liquidity will Peak or the
00:52:51.760 cycle will peak in late 25 for the
00:52:54.160 reasons I've I've already articulated so
00:52:56.599 I think that there's a a maturity wall
00:52:58.599 of debt that's got to be refinanced I
00:53:00.599 think the world real economy could be
00:53:02.160 stronger by then and it's it's
00:53:04.520 conceivable uh at least not not uh you
00:53:07.319 know not impossible that policy makers
00:53:09.520 could by that stage be thinking about
00:53:10.880 tightening policy again if inflation
00:53:12.559 becomes more of an issue so I think
00:53:15.200 these These are factors take into
00:53:16.599 account however what we also got to
00:53:18.960 accept is the trend in liquidity is a
00:53:21.000 lot faster and the trend in liquidity is
00:53:23.280 a lot faster because government deficits
00:53:25.440 are bigger and if you take it again
00:53:28.319 looking at the us as a benchmark and
00:53:31.000 again I'm not hitting on the US the US
00:53:33.040 is in many cases the sort of clean his
00:53:34.920 shirt in the laundry but the US has the
00:53:37.079 advantage that it's very transparent
00:53:39.480 it's provide they provide lots of data
00:53:41.880 they project into the future and one can
00:53:43.559 actually analyze uh the US fiscal
00:53:45.839 situation in great great detail and the
00:53:48.640 Congressional budget office produces an
00:53:50.960 excellent uh you know series of
00:53:52.839 projections of US debt us spending and
00:53:55.599 US tax revenue
00:53:56.960 and if you look at spending outlays
00:53:59.240 spending outlays currently as we speak
00:54:02.520 are 40% higher than they were before
00:54:04.920 covid 40 okay there's been a step change
00:54:08.440 taxation hasn't gone up to anything like
00:54:10.319 the same magnitude it's very difficult
00:54:12.400 to increase taxes on people um you know
00:54:15.480 and of uh you know I would venture that
00:54:17.799 nobody none of the uh the presidential
00:54:20.760 candidates in the US and none of the
00:54:22.480 political parties are talking about
00:54:23.799 cutting back on spending or raising
00:54:25.680 taxes you know enormously so these
00:54:28.559 deficits are going to be embedded the uh
00:54:31.000 Congressional budget office projects
00:54:33.400 that the US um fiscal deficit is going
00:54:36.119 to run on at something like 5 to 6% per
00:54:39.160 anom uh over the medium term uh and this
00:54:42.079 is a structural deficit it may even be
00:54:43.920 more than that uh we got to add into
00:54:45.720 that extra defense spending of course
00:54:47.880 and the CBO never never projects future
00:54:50.760 recessions which also cause bigger
00:54:52.680 deficits as well so uh they're likely
00:54:55.160 giving an underestimate of the of the
00:54:57.240 truth uh historically we've been used to
00:55:00.280 1 or 2% uh deficits or one deficits one
00:55:04.440 or two% of GDP I should say for a few
00:55:06.799 years but nothing of this magnitude that
00:55:09.119 we're that they are projecting for the
00:55:11.280 future that has to be funded and that is
00:55:14.839 a good Benchmark as to the sort of
00:55:16.880 growth in liquidity that is likely to be
00:55:19.240 required so that will translate into
00:55:21.480 something like an 8 to 10% annual
00:55:23.920 increase in liquidity conditions um um H
00:55:27.359 well you know for the us and that will
00:55:29.920 that will translate worldwide as well
00:55:32.039 and so what you've got to do is to think
00:55:33.720 about that uh in terms of asset
00:55:36.280 allocation if you've got monetary
00:55:38.000 inflation of 8 to 10% per anom what
00:55:41.319 asset should you own um and I think the
00:55:44.400 answer has got to be dedicated monetary
00:55:46.599 inflation Hedges uh we know that gold is
00:55:49.119 the long-standing
00:55:50.359 beneficiary uh in that regard uh it's
00:55:52.960 had an excellent performance this year
00:55:55.240 it's had an excellent performance
00:55:56.280 performance since year 2000 uh it's
00:55:58.440 probably had an excellent performance
00:55:59.799 since year zero in fact um you know um U
00:56:04.640 simply because gold is a is a
00:56:06.400 traditional monetary hedge um and
00:56:10.440 Bitcoin has proved itself in The Last 5
00:56:13.119 Years to be a great monetary hedge it's
00:56:16.599 been digital gold in many cases now I'm
00:56:19.440 not an expert on bitcoin nor on crypto
00:56:21.359 so that's a wealth warning but it seems
00:56:23.440 as if what you see is what you get here
00:56:25.839 and if you've got monetary inflation you
00:56:27.799 really want an asset where you've got
00:56:29.920 limited uh long-term Supply uh Bitcoin
00:56:33.200 is cut off at 21 million uh Bitcoin so
00:56:36.440 we're getting close to that threshold
00:56:38.039 already and the other thing that uh that
00:56:41.039 Bitcoin probably offers uh is security I
00:56:44.319 mean it's a decentralized system uh it's
00:56:47.319 got protocols that work and look to be
00:56:50.280 secure so at the end of the day maybe
00:56:52.960 it's a decent asset for people to think
00:56:54.599 about exactly and that's what I want to
00:56:56.960 talk about right now so we've
00:56:58.599 established what Global liquidity is
00:57:00.400 where it's headed uh what its main
00:57:01.960 drivers are so uh now just uh as you
00:57:05.319 said um why is it so important uh that
00:57:09.880 why is the correlation so important from
00:57:11.760 Global equity and Bitcoin how come it's
00:57:13.680 so correlated is it because it's a good
00:57:15.839 monetary hedge or or because of the
00:57:19.359 scarcity you just said I think I I I
00:57:21.599 wish I knew the answer uh Jack I think
00:57:23.839 the I think the what it comes down to is
00:57:26.440 probably thinking in these terms that if
00:57:29.079 you've got if you think about Bitcoin
00:57:31.359 and this is my my interpretation so I
00:57:33.280 mean it's pure
00:57:35.480 speculation if you think of Bitcoin
00:57:37.359 there are two Dimensions there's an
00:57:39.799 intensive margin and an extensive margin
00:57:42.559 and let me describe what I mean by that
00:57:44.400 the extensive margin is lots of people
00:57:47.440 owning $100 of Bitcoin okay and that
00:57:51.680 moving from um let's say 10 people to
00:57:55.079 100 people to 10, th000 people to a
00:57:57.359 million people to maybe 10 million
00:57:59.200 people now that's the extensive margin
00:58:01.520 growth okay and that is like the take up
00:58:04.359 of anything being it be it uh uh you
00:58:07.680 know be it transistor radios to uh you
00:58:11.119 know the internet to mobile phones you
00:58:13.839 get an s-shaped growth curve uh
00:58:16.480 reflecting the takeup of new
00:58:18.720 technologies so that's the extensive
00:58:21.039 margin so Bitcoin is following that
00:58:23.319 s-shaped growth curve the other element
00:58:26.119 is the Intensive margin and that's where
00:58:27.960 the monetary hedge bid I think comes in
00:58:30.920 and that's really like saying uh you
00:58:32.920 know I've got a $100 in Bitcoin now but
00:58:36.559 I think wow I think there's going to be
00:58:38.640 more monetary inflation in the future
00:58:40.720 therefore I'm going to put $5,000 in
00:58:43.160 Bitcoin or if I'm an institution I might
00:58:45.359 say well I'm going to put you know $50
00:58:47.400 million of my institutional money in a
00:58:50.520 in Bitcoin so that's the Intensive
00:58:53.359 margin and that's much more about
00:58:54.880 monetary Hedge so I think if you put
00:58:56.960 these two things together and multiply
00:58:58.760 them uh the Intensive margin and the
00:59:00.760 external and the extensive margin you
00:59:03.160 probably get somewhere to explaining why
00:59:05.760 Bitcoin has been going up so much um you
00:59:08.520 know in The Last 5 Years it's highly
00:59:11.000 sensitive to liquidity that's for sure
00:59:14.280 but that may be a slightly fake
00:59:16.000 statistic or uh exaggerated statistic
00:59:18.960 you know uh overestimated simply because
00:59:21.960 you've got to uh allow for two things
00:59:24.280 one is the monetary inflation Dynamic
00:59:26.880 and the other is the s-shaped growth
00:59:29.079 curve of a take up of a new product yeah
00:59:31.960 and then so I think uh for example
00:59:33.799 myself and every analyst in Bitcoin is
00:59:36.599 currently trying to Value Bitcoin trying
00:59:38.480 to find a good valuation method on how
00:59:40.839 to Value Bitcoin and um there's one
00:59:43.760 really good one I saw in your book but
00:59:46.000 you didn't talk about Bitcoin but I
00:59:47.440 think it can be applied so basically
00:59:49.640 since we can not use traditional PE
00:59:51.720 ratios to Value Bitcoin since there are
00:59:53.599 no earnings uh in your book you
00:59:55.559 mentioned different valuation methods uh
00:59:57.880 the PM ratio so the price to money or
01:00:00.359 the investor power model um and this
01:00:02.920 really piqued my interest and do you
01:00:04.720 think this can be something that can be
01:00:06.160 applied to bitcoin and have you modeled
01:00:08.480 it out yet absolutely but I mean that
01:00:11.160 that's pretty much what what we do when
01:00:13.000 we try and understand asset allocation
01:00:15.160 is to look at these relationships so
01:00:17.000 what we're so one of the things that I
01:00:18.960 can't remember if I put this in in the
01:00:20.280 book or not but it's certainly you know
01:00:22.240 something we've expressed over the years
01:00:24.760 is that you know one month one
01:00:26.359 established monetary inflation hedge is
01:00:28.160 gold okay gold at the moment is I think
01:00:32.240 about 1 or 2% uh by value of all
01:00:35.760 Financial assets
01:00:37.440 worldwide in the
01:00:40.039 1970s and I just about remember the
01:00:42.559 1970s but um in the
01:00:45.440 1970s uh I'm sure I'm correct in saying
01:00:48.240 that a lot of Swiss banks or wealth
01:00:50.079 managers would have had at least 15% of
01:00:53.640 their clients portfolios in Gold okay
01:00:56.280 okay uh not 1% not 2% but 15% okay now
01:01:01.720 if we're in a monetary inflation world
01:01:04.240 uh we're likely to get gold uh becoming
01:01:07.680 uh a much more substantial part of
01:01:09.359 portfolios now we can debate what that
01:01:11.520 may be but let's say goes to 5% so in
01:01:16.319 other words the stock of gold or the uh
01:01:18.559 the the value of gold in portfolios will
01:01:21.880 at least double uh more likely triple
01:01:24.440 from where we are now okay now Bitcoin
01:01:27.000 is nowhere near the percentage of gold
01:01:29.400 right and I would have said Bitcoin uh
01:01:32.079 if it's a viable monetary inflation
01:01:34.039 hedge has to get somewhere near the
01:01:36.400 capitalization of
01:01:37.839 gold as it is now but it may even be
01:01:41.400 that Bitcoin has to get up to where gold
01:01:43.079 will eventually end up which may be 5%
01:01:45.839 or so of portfolios so I think that's
01:01:47.920 the sort of benchmarks I would tend to
01:01:49.480 think of and if I come back from sort of
01:01:51.599 first principles and I say well okay if
01:01:53.720 I'm dividing up a portfolio myself in
01:01:56.680 terms of asset allocation uh let's think
01:01:59.240 about a good long-term portfolio that
01:02:01.720 would be robust uh to to events and
01:02:05.440 robust to monetary inflation I'd be
01:02:07.440 putting something like 60% of that in
01:02:10.279 equities and good good quality equities
01:02:12.839 uh I'd be putting uh the other 40%
01:02:15.880 probably distributed something like um
01:02:18.599 you know 10% in uh in things like gold
01:02:22.079 and Bitcoin um so you could take five
01:02:25.079 five each for example example uh I'd be
01:02:27.279 putting some into Prime residential real
01:02:29.880 estate as an investment because that's a
01:02:31.920 pretty good long-term monetary inflation
01:02:33.640 hedge I'd be thinking about treasury
01:02:35.920 inflation protected securities uh and
01:02:38.559 then I might put the other uh 10% in
01:02:41.960 things like cash or high yield bonds or
01:02:44.440 something like that but I would not have
01:02:46.440 government bonds have you heard about
01:02:47.920 the three-pillar portfolio from L Elden
01:02:50.559 no uh no it's I think it's exactly what
01:02:52.880 you're describing right so I think uh
01:02:55.839 every major macro analyst agrees that
01:02:58.400 currently we have to prepare for a
01:03:00.400 monetary hedge and I think Bitcoin and
01:03:03.200 gold play big part in that um so moving
01:03:06.359 on so as well in your book you mentioned
01:03:08.440 Global liquidity index preced asset
01:03:10.720 price moves so Bond markets and Forex by
01:03:13.559 3 to 6 months Equity markets by 6 to 12
01:03:16.440 months and real economy by 5 to 20
01:03:18.599 months so what about Bitcoin and
01:03:20.960 gold yeah very good questions I mean th
01:03:24.160 those those factors that you or those
01:03:26.440 lead times that you cited we actually
01:03:28.880 Pro that empirically in the book so we
01:03:31.400 do statistical analysis to show those
01:03:33.279 lead times and we corroborate that by
01:03:35.799 using things like Griner causality
01:03:37.440 analysis to actually establish that uh
01:03:39.520 in a robust way uh we've used similar
01:03:42.200 tests for gold uh and Bitcoin um the
01:03:46.799 interesting I mean the interesting fact
01:03:48.880 is that if you look at gold uh gold
01:03:51.839 tends to gold and gold and Global
01:03:54.920 liquidity tend to have a sort of mixed
01:03:57.319 relationship there are times you know I
01:03:59.760 I would accept that gold can lead Global
01:04:02.319 liquidity but most of the time Global
01:04:04.319 equility tends to lead gold and the lead
01:04:06.880 time has been about 3 to 6 months
01:04:09.119 generally speaking if you look at
01:04:11.799 Bitcoin uh and actually i' this is fresh
01:04:15.279 in my mind because I was only doing it
01:04:16.599 in the last few days again refreshing
01:04:18.279 the data it seems that Bitcoin is moving
01:04:21.799 with about with a remarkably short lead
01:04:24.480 time of about 12 12
01:04:26.480 weeks um and I don't know why but it
01:04:30.559 seems to be uncount the case yeah and so
01:04:33.839 that's what I wrote down as well 8 to 12
01:04:35.799 weeks and the thing what you say as well
01:04:38.200 is interesting because you said uh gold
01:04:41.079 um preds uh Global liquidity by 3 to six
01:04:43.880 months uh no no I said I said I said
01:04:45.960 there are times when gold can proceed
01:04:48.079 but generally liquidity leads by about 3
01:04:50.240 to six months okay because I have an
01:04:52.839 other Bitcoin analyst Charles Edwards uh
01:04:55.760 and he says that Bitcoin lags Gold by
01:04:57.960 about 3 to six months I don't know if
01:05:00.480 that's correct and that you have the
01:05:01.720 same research well i' I was looking at
01:05:05.520 this recently and I mean there there is
01:05:07.520 a case for saying that that's true um
01:05:12.079 yeah I mean but it's I wouldn't I
01:05:14.880 wouldn't want to hang my hat on because
01:05:16.520 it does it doesn't look a particularly
01:05:17.839 strong relationship but there there is a
01:05:19.720 case for saying that for sure yeah and I
01:05:22.319 think if you read this it was just
01:05:24.200 released yesterday so Lynn Elden um put
01:05:27.079 a research report of global liquidity
01:05:29.079 and Bitcoin and apparently the
01:05:31.119 directional movement is 83% so if Global
01:05:34.279 liquidity Rises 83% of the times Bitcoin
01:05:37.279 Rises as well uh and this is the highest
01:05:39.599 correlation in every assets um but I
01:05:42.440 don't think she measured it in global
01:05:44.200 liquidity I think she just used
01:05:46.839 M2 well that may be I mean I'm I'm I'm
01:05:50.160 you know my my background is the
01:05:51.799 statisticians so um I'm extremely
01:05:55.279 cautious about anyone saying you get
01:05:57.480 very high correlations uh of that
01:05:59.680 magnitude I mean that sounds to me like
01:06:01.440 spe is correlation uh I I I'd like to
01:06:04.200 see that but you've really got to I mean
01:06:06.480 the whole problem is without getting
01:06:08.000 into the weeds of Statistics uh I mean
01:06:10.960 the question is th those two series are
01:06:14.160 uh they're going to be co-integrated so
01:06:16.440 there's a they're dominated by a trend
01:06:18.200 so what that 83% is picking up it's
01:06:20.440 largely a trend not a fluctuation which
01:06:22.640 is slightly different but I mean I take
01:06:24.200 the point without without stealing her
01:06:26.160 Thunder that they are they're clearly
01:06:28.200 connected just questioning whether it's
01:06:30.160 an 80 83% R squ which seems remarkably
01:06:34.119 high I can send you the report uh later
01:06:36.720 do that um and so why do you think
01:06:38.880 Bitcoin is so sensitive in moves to
01:06:40.839 Global liquidity more than other
01:06:45.160 assets well I I'm look all I'd say is
01:06:48.680 that I think that it's uh it's a cleaner
01:06:51.400 asset class um than gold um in terms of
01:06:56.480 its monetary inflation hedging
01:06:59.480 properties and the reason and I'm just
01:07:01.880 saying this in terms of uh looking at a
01:07:04.480 number of Dynamics I mean if you come
01:07:06.440 back to you know why is this a monetary
01:07:08.720 inflation
01:07:09.960 hedge it really is is two things one is
01:07:13.920 that it's secure right um the technology
01:07:18.319 is secure the ownership is secure Etc
01:07:21.039 and the second thing is the supply is
01:07:22.640 limited and it's those two factors that
01:07:24.880 drive the demand for Bitcoin now if you
01:07:27.960 look at gold gold is
01:07:30.160 secure but there's a problem with gold
01:07:32.200 is it's really quite heavy and it's very
01:07:34.039 difficult to move around so you've got
01:07:35.520 to discount gold a little bit for that
01:07:37.599 factor anyway the other thing is that
01:07:39.720 the supply of gold is um uh sort of well
01:07:45.160 difficult to analyze because you've got
01:07:47.400 first of all the bullion Banks who
01:07:49.200 operate the gold market who do a lot of
01:07:52.520 um uh syruptitious dealing and Short
01:07:55.960 Selling and whatever and it's very
01:07:58.200 difficult really to understand the
01:07:59.599 Dynamics of what's going on short term
01:08:01.799 with gold I mean there's a lot of
01:08:02.920 manipulation of the price uh in my view
01:08:06.200 uh Supply is also a question I mean you
01:08:09.559 have got Supply coming into the market
01:08:11.760 uh from private producers but then
01:08:13.960 equally what you've got which is
01:08:15.279 disturbing the the situation is that
01:08:17.679 central banks particularly uh let's say
01:08:21.439 uh um um C well let me say Central Bank
01:08:25.679 s uh outside of the West um so China um
01:08:30.719 Russia uh the brick economies and their
01:08:33.640 friends all want to accumulate gold as
01:08:36.640 part of their foreign exchange reserves
01:08:38.479 so that's also creating a a dynamic
01:08:41.319 which is interfering with the normal
01:08:42.799 with the normal Trends and that may be
01:08:44.040 something which has propelled gold uh
01:08:45.839 upwards in the very near term so I think
01:08:48.439 that you've got those factors to come
01:08:49.880 into account so I think generally
01:08:51.679 speaking Bitcoin seems to be cleaner
01:08:54.279 there's uh you've got You' got security
01:08:56.120 you've got fixed Supply the one
01:08:57.839 uncertainty which I'm not an expert in
01:09:00.839 and I don't know how to you know to
01:09:02.679 quantify it is there may well have been
01:09:05.439 short selling of Bitcoin because of the
01:09:07.799 E the ETFs now I don't know if that's
01:09:10.600 for sure but I would suspect that
01:09:12.198 something like that's going on so we may
01:09:14.560 have another uncertainty in the near
01:09:16.120 term for Bitcoin But ultimately Bitcoin
01:09:18.839 is fixed Supply gold isn't yeah all
01:09:23.040 right um and then so I heard you saying
01:09:25.759 this in uh in another podcast so um how
01:09:29.600 much does Bitcoin and gold rise by an
01:09:31.640 expansion in global liquidity
01:09:33.759 percentagewise well I can give you the
01:09:35.799 historic data and the historic data is
01:09:38.279 that uh and this is based over the last
01:09:40.040 five
01:09:41.120 years and this is comes from regression
01:09:43.560 analysis so again it's a wealth warning
01:09:45.799 because it won't be the same in the
01:09:47.120 future but it will give you a benchmark
01:09:49.359 gold is a multiplier of about 1.5 so for
01:09:52.198 every 10% increase in liquidity you get
01:09:54.400 a 15% expansion in Gold okay and that's
01:09:57.960 more or less actually what's happened
01:09:59.320 this year I me it's it's not been that
01:10:01.840 that out of line if you look at Bitcoin
01:10:04.679 the answer has been 4.5 so it's been a
01:10:07.199 10% increase in liquidity 45% increase
01:10:10.280 in the price of Bitcoin will that be
01:10:12.120 true going forward unlikely but it will
01:10:14.199 still be a high number yeah and so then
01:10:16.840 I was thinking based on that so you say
01:10:19.440 that the global liquidity cycle will
01:10:21.640 topping in late
01:10:24.199 20225 uh and how much do you expect the
01:10:27.120 global liquidity to increase and based
01:10:29.640 on that if it's I don't know say 50%
01:10:32.800 then you have to do the multiplier of
01:10:34.159 4.5 and then you can then we can maybe
01:10:36.560 have like a Bitcoin cycle top price
01:10:39.159 based on that yeah well I think the um I
01:10:42.840 mean I did a podcast a few days ago
01:10:44.719 where I was talking that people who look
01:10:46.239 at Power laws in Bitcoin and we both
01:10:49.440 concluded my independent assessment
01:10:51.440 there' be a peak or be it maybe a
01:10:53.199 temporary peak in Bitcoin around late
01:10:55.600 2025 and they came to exactly the same
01:10:58.080 conclusion uh looking at mathematical
01:11:00.239 algorithms rather than uh my analysis of
01:11:02.560 liquidity so there may be something in
01:11:04.840 that I don't know who who knows but uh
01:11:07.800 at the end of the day I come back to the
01:11:09.719 point that there is a trend in a cycle
01:11:12.159 and the cycle is really a cycle in
01:11:14.520 growth ratees so you're going to get uh
01:11:16.600 you know growth uh you know accelerating
01:11:20.719 uh over the next 12 months but peeking
01:11:22.480 out and then uh ultimately uh the cycle
01:11:25.920 coming back to Trend and moving below
01:11:27.679 Trend but that trend is rising fast and
01:11:30.840 as I said the trend is rising at a rate
01:11:33.000 of about 8 to 10% per anom okay now if
01:11:35.640 you s look at compound interest that
01:11:37.800 means that the uh that the stock of
01:11:39.760 liquidity is doubling about every 10
01:11:42.400 years in fact it's less than 10 years
01:11:44.159 but it's doubling about every 10 years
01:11:45.560 let's say um therefore the price of
01:11:48.120 Bitcoin should at least double every 10
01:11:50.080 years uh but if you've got a higher
01:11:52.280 multiplier on bitcoin then you've got a
01:11:55.520 you've got a a scale factor increase
01:11:58.199 yeah and so how much do you think Global
01:12:00.000 liquidity will expend in percentage um
01:12:03.760 till the top in late
01:12:05.679 2025 oh I think that you know I I would
01:12:08.239 imagine that we're probably going to see
01:12:10.400 an increase from here of about
01:12:13.800 15% all right so and then we do that
01:12:16.520 times 4 and a half and then we have our
01:12:18.639 bitcoin price for the yeah but that that
01:12:20.360 that would be the top but I mean yeah
01:12:22.080 you could yeah you can you can put a
01:12:24.199 ruler around that and see get to yeah
01:12:26.480 and do you think that will get front run
01:12:28.600 for example you said that Bitcoin lags
01:12:30.800 Global liquidity by about 12 weeks so
01:12:33.360 that's what the data shows so do you
01:12:34.600 think then the Bitcoin top will be 12
01:12:36.760 weeks after the top in global liquidity
01:12:38.880 could or do you think it will be front
01:12:40.400 run uh I I don't know I mean I think
01:12:42.239 that you know I mean one of the things
01:12:43.440 that you've definitely seen uh in
01:12:46.040 markets I mean this this is without
01:12:47.880 question um that that time lag between a
01:12:51.280 moving liquidity and a moving Bitcoin
01:12:53.120 has actually Constantin uh in Wards it's
01:12:55.679 basically got narrower and narrower
01:12:57.159 shorter and shorter so you know it's uh
01:12:59.840 if you go back four or five years it was
01:13:02.280 counted in months now it's counted in
01:13:03.840 weeks now what's the reason for that uh
01:13:06.639 I don't know but all I'd say is a lot
01:13:08.480 more Quant funds the big Quant funds are
01:13:10.440 actually looking at liquidity we Supply
01:13:12.560 data to all of the big us Quant funds
01:13:15.280 and um you know maybe they're using this
01:13:17.159 as part of their input I don't know all
01:13:20.080 right and why do you think Bitcoin has a
01:13:22.239 higher multiplier than gold is the
01:13:25.159 because of it's a smaller assets well I
01:13:27.280 think it's I think you've got the to
01:13:28.760 come back to my analogy of saying you've
01:13:30.280 got this intensive and extensive margin
01:13:32.320 which are driving growth I think you've
01:13:34.239 got the s-shaped growth curve of this
01:13:36.800 takeup of Bitcoin because it's a new
01:13:39.360 technology uh more and more people are
01:13:41.600 buying it there's more uh people with
01:13:43.800 $100 in Bitcoin uh but that's growing
01:13:46.480 you know growing fast that's coming on
01:13:48.520 top of uh the Intensive margin growth so
01:13:52.040 I think you've got uh you know these two
01:13:53.639 things coming on top of another that's
01:13:54.840 what I would argue all right and then
01:13:57.440 another question is maybe a little more
01:13:59.159 crypto related um so when during the
01:14:02.000 liquidity cycle do you want to go
01:14:04.159 further down the risk curve so for
01:14:05.719 example uh that you would go from
01:14:07.719 Bitcoin to even maybe altcoins and maybe
01:14:10.560 even mean coins I don't say you want to
01:14:12.560 do this but maybe some listeners want to
01:14:14.679 go further down the risk curve and when
01:14:16.400 exact in the global liquidity cycle
01:14:18.320 would be a right time to do that well
01:14:20.800 the answer the answer unquestionably is
01:14:22.960 is near the bottom of the cycle uh not
01:14:25.239 top uh you want to buy at the bottom and
01:14:27.199 sell towards the top and that that's for
01:14:29.280 sure so you know I mean we're about
01:14:31.600 Midway through the cycle right now in
01:14:33.880 terms of liquidity I mean the the the
01:14:37.159 sort of caveat here is that you know as
01:14:39.080 I say to people look I mean bull markets
01:14:41.360 always climb a wall of worry uh people
01:14:44.000 people other people have been saying
01:14:45.560 don't invest the whole thing is going to
01:14:47.040 fall apart uh you know we're we're about
01:14:49.320 to hit a bare Market valuations are too
01:14:51.600 high they've been saying that for the
01:14:53.120 last two years okay market price have
01:14:55.199 still gone up uh and you've got to
01:14:56.960 accept the fact that investing from now
01:14:59.840 uh until late 25 is not going to be
01:15:01.639 anything like as rewarding as investing
01:15:03.560 starting two years ago okay so a lot of
01:15:05.719 the gains have already passed us by uh
01:15:08.159 there will be further gains but it's
01:15:09.520 really a question of rotating into other
01:15:11.960 assets it so happens I think gold has
01:15:14.280 still got much further to go and I think
01:15:16.920 bitcoin's got much further to go I think
01:15:19.000 that commodity related stocks have got
01:15:20.800 further to go but you know I wouldn't
01:15:23.840 necessarily believe that you're going to
01:15:25.320 see uh you know the same sort of gains
01:15:28.159 out of the US Stock Market that you've
01:15:30.320 seen for the last two years I mean that
01:15:32.120 you know that's probably coming to the
01:15:33.800 end of the party or towards the end of
01:15:35.239 the party better to start rotating into
01:15:37.400 other areas of the world yeah but isn't
01:15:39.440 it when there is even more liquidity in
01:15:41.360 the system uh people get even more risk
01:15:43.719 on and even riskier assets perform
01:15:46.440 better yeah that's true but the top end
01:15:48.760 of the cycle yeah yeah that's true I
01:15:50.120 mean things you get acceleration for
01:15:52.440 sure but it's a it's a higher risk time
01:15:54.639 to invest yeah of
01:15:56.679 course uh if you think you can get out
01:15:59.280 you know as they say uh enjoy the party
01:16:01.480 but dance near the door um you know uh
01:16:04.120 that that's the thing you've got to be
01:16:05.159 able to pull the trigger quickly yeah
01:16:07.560 and that's maybe a difficult question um
01:16:11.600 what assets do you think will perform
01:16:13.400 better uh when the cycle is coming down
01:16:15.920 again so when liquidity is decreasing
01:16:18.320 again well okay I
01:16:20.400 mean it it depends uh I suppose it
01:16:24.040 depends a lot on the nature of of how
01:16:26.120 quickly liquidity comes down and why
01:16:27.719 it's coming down but I would tend to
01:16:29.840 think that you would you would expect at
01:16:31.880 that stage that government bonds would
01:16:34.040 perform well because they are still
01:16:36.840 conceded considered to be the safe asset
01:16:39.480 in the system so I think one's got to
01:16:41.400 recognize that that there may be a
01:16:42.760 temporary window for performance of
01:16:44.080 government bonds and I'm cynical enough
01:16:46.199 to suggest that at some stage
01:16:48.440 governments will want to push people out
01:16:49.880 of risk assets back into the sovereign
01:16:51.600 debt markets so they can improve their
01:16:53.480 funding abilities so so you know that
01:16:56.040 that that must be the case at some stage
01:16:58.480 uh cash is always a pretty good
01:17:00.239 investment to have but you
01:17:02.560 know maybe and I just raised this as a
01:17:05.480 point maybe the world is getting wiser
01:17:07.840 to what the central banks are doing and
01:17:09.800 they realize that if there is a falling
01:17:12.080 liquidity and there's a riskk of of
01:17:14.120 financial crisis uh that they know that
01:17:16.480 central banks will come back in again
01:17:17.800 there'll be a a fed put or whatever you
01:17:19.760 would like to call it which will support
01:17:21.320 the markets and you know that must be
01:17:24.199 that's a realist
01:17:25.560 statement the simple reason that we're
01:17:27.360 living in a very fragile Financial world
01:17:31.000 uh of existing world where you've got
01:17:33.360 existing you know these big debts you've
01:17:35.480 got the structure the existing structure
01:17:37.120 of uh financial markets which uh are
01:17:40.360 very very fragile uh because they're
01:17:42.840 based on on weak collateral and and lots
01:17:46.639 of Leverage and you need the central
01:17:48.400 banks there to paper over the cracks all
01:17:50.040 the time but the more the central banks
01:17:52.679 paper over the cracks the more they're
01:17:54.440 pumping liquidity the more monetary
01:17:56.360 inflation you get the higher the gold
01:17:58.280 price goes and the higher Bitcoin goes
01:18:00.880 yeah so that's why I'm a bit skeptical
01:18:02.440 of the cycle right now do you maybe
01:18:04.280 think it can go even further than late
01:18:07.840 2025 well it's always possible I mean
01:18:10.440 I'm just I mean what do I base that 2025
01:18:13.800 view on I base on the fact that we've
01:18:15.600 seen um since the mid
01:18:18.480 1960s 65 U month Cycles repeating uh why
01:18:24.400 is that the case I I don't I don't
01:18:26.639 honestly know my conjectures uh come
01:18:29.560 down to it's a debt refinancing cycle um
01:18:32.960 and therefore I think I've got to you
01:18:34.199 know go with the data and think that's
01:18:35.520 what's going to happen again I may be
01:18:37.239 wrong and because of this uh of this
01:18:39.239 debt wall uh or this maturity wall that
01:18:42.120 we've got maybe it's it's pushed out a
01:18:43.880 bit more I don't know maybe central
01:18:45.480 banks have got wise to this and they
01:18:47.000 think we've got to add a lot more
01:18:48.159 liquidity to the system to prevent there
01:18:50.239 being major default uh I mean the you
01:18:52.719 know the other question to think about
01:18:55.639 is will there be another financial
01:18:58.040 crisis yeah there will of course there
01:19:00.960 will be because the fact is that debt
01:19:03.880 grows exponentially and liquidity is
01:19:06.239 cyclical so you look at those two
01:19:08.000 mathematical curves and they're they're
01:19:09.480 bound to uh you move apart at some stage
01:19:11.800 so there might be a um a recession or a
01:19:15.000 crisis right after the top of the
01:19:16.800 liquidity cycle you think quite possible
01:19:18.520 all right quite possible uh and then
01:19:20.960 cash would be the better assets or or
01:19:22.600 still gold and Bitcoin well no I think
01:19:24.880 that I think I think uh what history
01:19:28.320 shows and it showed it showed definitely
01:19:31.080 in the case of 2008 uh in the case of
01:19:33.840 gold is that gold sold off because
01:19:35.840 basically it's a very liquid asset and
01:19:38.320 if people are doing fire sales of assets
01:19:40.800 you know if you if you've got a if You'
01:19:42.600 got a a block of gold uh and you're
01:19:45.120 looking at your NASDAQ stocks and your
01:19:46.920 NASDAQ stocks have just Fallen 8 80% uh
01:19:49.800 you're more willing to sell your gold
01:19:51.760 right than you know try and liquidate um
01:19:54.719 your technology stocks so I think that
01:19:56.679 you know those are the sort of assets
01:19:58.080 that become very liquid uh and very
01:20:00.520 transferable in a situation where you're
01:20:01.960 going to market crash um Bitcoin I'm not
01:20:04.840 sure will I mean the TR with trouble
01:20:06.760 with Bitcoin is there's an awful lot of
01:20:08.080 emotion in Bitcoin too yeah yeah all
01:20:11.639 right so um this was it let's maybe wrap
01:20:14.560 it up uh to recap what are your final
01:20:16.679 thoughts on bitcoin and Global liquidity
01:20:19.040 for the rest of the year and maybe next
01:20:21.280 year well I think that the most
01:20:23.719 important thing for people to look at or
01:20:25.239 to understand at least is is This Global
01:20:27.679 liquidity concept I think that's the all
01:20:29.600 important one certainly it is for me so
01:20:31.760 it's a question of uh you know not not
01:20:33.880 watching um Central Bank interest rate
01:20:36.600 discussions or whatever and getting
01:20:37.920 overly fixated by what the fomc in
01:20:40.320 America is doing it's actually looking
01:20:42.040 at the amount of liquidity that's been
01:20:43.800 created in the system um that's
01:20:46.320 important um I think that cycle is still
01:20:49.440 going up uh that cycle uh hit bottom in
01:20:52.440 late 22 uh it's like to hit its peak
01:20:56.040 around late 25 I think uh we still got
01:20:58.880 further to go um what does that mean for
01:21:02.040 Bitcoin gold I think that both of them
01:21:04.600 uh can push higher uh gold is already at
01:21:06.840 an all-time high but I think it's going
01:21:08.199 to go even even higher uh Bitcoin is not
01:21:10.880 far off it's alltime high but I think
01:21:12.480 that's going to go higher as well uh I
01:21:14.760 think these are assets you hold for the
01:21:16.120 long term uh generally but one has to
01:21:18.960 recognize the cycle uh the cycle is uh
01:21:21.719 is coming down as I said probably in
01:21:23.639 about 12 months time
01:21:25.440 um and that may be a bump who knows but
01:21:28.080 at the end of the day uh think about the
01:21:30.120 compounding effect the trend uh that's
01:21:32.239 going on behind that and Global equility
01:21:34.600 is compounding over the next few decades
01:21:36.960 at 8 to 10% per anom that's the reality
01:21:39.840 that's all about the big debt burden
01:21:41.440 we've got in the world economy and debt
01:21:43.440 ain't going out of fashion politicians
01:21:45.080 that just kicking the can down the road
01:21:46.880 they're taking on more and more
01:21:49.320 debt that easy amazing so uh one last
01:21:53.000 thing so I believe a lot of my view
01:21:54.600 viewers uh look up to you um so if you
01:21:57.600 would give them one piece of Life advice
01:21:59.440 not Financial advice life advice what
01:22:01.480 would that
01:22:02.520 be uh don't get overly fixated by
01:22:05.040 financial markets go do something more
01:22:06.639 interesting like art paint a picture but

Conclusion
As the dust settles on a transformative 2024, Bitcoin’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Building on the catalysts of the previous year, two major forces are poised to shape Bitcoin’s trajectory: nation-state adoption and the growing influence of large-scale players, including corporations and institutions. These factors have the potential to redefine market dynamics, overshadowing traditional drivers such as the halving cycle and the influence of retail investors.

Here’s a closer look at the central factors likely to define Bitcoin's path in 2025.

2024 recap
In 2024, Bitcoin experienced a remarkable rise, appreciating approximately 120% between January 1 and December 5. At the time of writing, Bitcoin recently reached the historic milestone of $100,000 on December 5.

This growth has been primarily supported by three historic events: the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10, the Bitcoin halving on April 20 and the election of Donald Trump on November 5.

The introduction of spot ETFs broadened accessibility for investors, while Trump’s pro-crypto stance signalled a favourable political outlook, both of which visibly boosted Bitcoin’s price. In contrast, the halving, which reduced the rate of new Bitcoin supply, initially had a less positive effect. Following the halving, Bitcoin's price trended sideways and then fell by approximately 25% over the next five months.

These factors are interconnected and difficult to separate, but their influence will likely persist throughout 2025.

Nation-state adoption
The nation-state adoption of Bitcoin, which is the process of integrating Bitcoin into national financial systems, could play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin's price path in 2025. To date, this type of adoption has taken place across three main areas: national reserves, legal tender status, and government Bitcoin mining operations.

Proactive pioneers
El Salvador and Bhutan have made the most proactive moves in adopting Bitcoin officially. In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to declare Bitcoin legal tender. Although its use as a medium of exchange remains limited, the country's government has steadily increased its Bitcoin holdings, which now total ~6,150 BTC as of November 25, according to Van Eck.

The Salvadoran government has also pioneered Bitcoin mining, using geothermal energy sourced from volcanic activity. Bhutan has been mining Bitcoin since 2019, utilising its hydroelectric power, and currently holds reserves exceeding 12,000 BTC as of December 2.

Sleeping giants
The United States, China, and the United Kingdom hold some of the largest Bitcoin reserves globally. However, as far as we know, all of these holdings were seized from criminals rather than proactively purchased. In the U.S. alone, the top three Bitcoin seizures account for the vast majority of their total holdings. Unlike in El Salvador, Bitcoin holdings in the U.S., China, and the United Kingdom have been retained by governments but have not been explicitly used as reserve assets for value storage or economic stability.

However, there are recent signs that this stance may be beginning to shift. The concept of Bitcoin as a reserve asset gained traction in 2024 among U.S. political figures such as Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Senator Cynthia Lummis, notably at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference.

Support for a Bitcoin strategic reserve
At the conference, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis outlined plans to establish a “Bitcoin strategic reserve,” which would include a network of secure storage vaults, a purchasing program, and measures to transparently manage federal Bitcoin holdings.

Lummis’ Bitcoin strategic reserve bill outlines acquiring 1 million BTC, equivalent to roughly 5% of the total supply, to hold for 20 years. She is also pushing for the U.S. Treasury to convert part of its 8,000 tonnes of gold holdings into Bitcoin to establish the BTC strategic reserve.

During the same conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voiced his ambition to “sign an executive order on day one” directing federal agencies to transfer approximately 200,000 Bitcoin seized by the U.S. government to the Treasury as strategic assets. He also proposed that the Treasury purchase 550 Bitcoin daily until reaching a reserve of at least 4 million. Though he initially made these statements while running for president, he later joined Trump’s campaign and was recently appointed as Health Secretary in the Trump administration.

Finally, Trump expressed his vision of American leadership in the Bitcoin arena, declaring (and yes, this is verbatim):

“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it mined, minted, and made in the USA. It’s not going to be made anywhere else. And if Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say, I want America to lead the way—and that’s what’s going to happen.”

Trump Bitcoin Nashville Conference 2024

The sentiments expressed at the Nashville conference raise a crucial question: will the U.S. follow through on its promise to purchase Bitcoin as a reserve asset in 2025?

Should they proceed, this move could meaningfully boost Bitcoin’s price and may prompt other countries to consider it as a reserve asset. As Fidelity noted in January 2022:

“There is a very high-stakes game theory at play here, whereby if Bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some Bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of Bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.”

The counterargument to consider is that adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset could be a double-edged sword. Governments risk undermining the authority they wield through their fiat currencies, which are tools for managing economies and exerting influence. Therefore, many governments may be more cautious and less eager to rush into a high-stakes game, particularly given the opposition to Bitcoin among many economists and policymakers.

A new regulatory chapter? 
Discussions of nation-state adoption and Trump's election is widely seen as a positive factor for Bitcoin-friendly regulation. Upon taking office on January 20, 2025, Trump will have the opportunity to reshape the leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

During his campaign, Trump publicly declared his intention to remove the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler. Gensler subsequently resigned on November 21. Trump has since picked Paul Atkins as his nominee to head the agency, who is seen as a cryptocurrency advocate. A new SEC Chair could bring significant changes, potentially introducing clearer regulations for digital assets under U.S. securities law. 

Moreover, as of December 2, the House of Representatives now includes 278 pro-crypto members compared to 122 who oppose crypto, providing Trump with increased leverage to influence crypto regulation in his preferred direction. For some, regulatory clarity has been a blocker to investment in Bitcoin, and this could mark a turning point. Looking globally, the UK is also expected to introduce a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework in early 2025, further contributing to the evolving regulatory landscape.

Corporate and institutional demand 
Even if nation-state adoption stalls, the growing interest from corporations and institutions could continue to support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in 2025. Broadly speaking, corporate demand primarily refers to large publicly listed companies acquiring Bitcoin to hold as a strategic asset on their balance sheets. Institutional demand, on the other hand, refers to investment activity by entities such as hedge funds, asset managers, and pension funds, which are typically acquiring Bitcoin on behalf of their clients.

Together, corporations and institutions represent a massive source of demand that could significantly impact Bitcoin's price trajectory in 2025. Their adoption of Bitcoin has far outpaced that of nation-states in recent years. As of December 2, public corporations currently hold around 508,024 BTC (~2.42% of the total supply), with the top holders being MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Tesla, and Coinbase. 

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been around for less than a year, already hold 1,246,585 BTC, representing 5.94% of the total supply. Leading the way are BlackRock (IBIT), Grayscale (GBTC), Fidelity (FBTC), ARK (ARKB), and Bitwise (BITB). In comparison, nation-states collectively hold just 524,246 BTC (2.50% of the total supply), and as mentioned previously, there is little actual demand from them at present. 

The Saylor effect 
Within the corporate and institutional landscape, MicroStrategy (MSTR:US) will be a key player to monitor in 2025. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, who is regarded as one of the world's biggest Bitcoin bulls, has shifted its focus from software development to acquiring Bitcoin as a corporate strategy. The company is heavily invested in Bitcoin, currently holding 386,700 BTC.

MicroStrategy's playbook in simple terms: it raises funds by issuing stock and debt instruments at low interest rates and then uses that capital to buy more Bitcoin. In October 2024, MicroStrategy has also recently announced plans to invest an additional $42 billion in Bitcoin over the next three years. 

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin purchases over time

MSTR’s large-scale purchasing could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price in the years ahead, particularly as supply becomes increasingly constrained. A key indicator to watch is illiquid supply, which refers to the percentage of Bitcoin held in wallets with little history of selling, often by long-term holders. This has recently reached a staggering record high of 74%. For context, out of Bitcoin’s circulating supply of 19.75 million, illiquid entities now hold 14.61 million BTC, according to ETC Group and Glassnode. This dynamic is not only relevant to Saylor but it is also relevant to the broader factors discussed in this outlook.

The accountants have arrived
Starting in 2025, a new FASB rule will require US companies to report cryptocurrency holdings at fair value each quarter. According to Deloitte, "The new guidance requires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period."

Previously, companies typically classified Bitcoin holdings as intangible assets subject to impairment testing. This meant Bitcoin held by a company could be written down if its price fell but could not be marked up until it was sold, even if the price recovered in the meantime.

For companies like MicroStrategy the new rule might offer a clearer way to report their cryptocurrency holdings. While the technical details and adoption will vary by company, the update could enhance transparency and influence how businesses approach Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Who’s next?
Beyond MicroStrategy, all eyes will be on major market cap players like NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta to see if they embrace Bitcoin in 2025. While many companies are exploring Bitcoin, it’s important to recognise the expanding interest from a wider range of institutions, including asset managers, family offices, and pension funds.

In May 2024, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became one of the first U.S. public pension funds to allocate to a spot Bitcoin ETF. By November 2024, a UK pension fund followed suit, making history by allocating 3% of its total assets to Bitcoin. Institutional and high-net-worth buying could prove pivotal in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory in 2025.

A new Bitcoin cycle?
The cyclical pattern of Bitcoin's peaks and troughs, roughly aligning with four-year intervals, is a widely observed and intriguing characteristic of Bitcoin. Identifying the exact cause of this pattern is complex, as it arises from a confluence of factors. Among these, notable cycles stand out: the Bitcoin halving cycle, the U.S. election cycle, and the liquidity cycle (though liquidity tends to span 4-5 years). During prior Bitcoin cycles, these factors have often shown a correlation with Bitcoin's price.

The potential for increased nation-state adoption, coupled with growing institutional and corporate demand, could significantly overshadow the traditional factors that have historically played dominant roles in Bitcoin’s cyclical patterns. To illustrate this, let’s zoom in on the halving. The Bitcoin halving is a pre-programmed event in Bitcoin’s code that ensures the issuance of new Bitcoin is cut in half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). The latest halving reduced daily Bitcoin issuance through mining to roughly 450 BTC.

Now, contrast this with a recent corporate purchase: in November 2024, MicroStrategy acquired 51,780 BTC worth $4.6 billion, a single purchase that is equivalent to absorbing 115 days of new supply assuming constant prices. To put this into even sharper perspective, MicroStrategy’s single November purchase represents less than 1/20 of the Bitcoin acquired so far by the US Bitcoin spot ETFs. In any case, in 2024, the supply reduction driven by corporations, institutions, and nation-states has significantly surpassed the built-in supply reduction induced by the halving. Looking ahead to 2025, this pattern is expected to continue, with external accumulations playing a dominant role in shaping Bitcoin's supply landscape.

The growing interest from nation-states and institutions in Bitcoin could have a significant impact on its traditional four-year market cycles. These new sources of demand raise the possibility of what is referred to as the 'supercycle', a speculative idea suggesting that Bitcoin’s price could experience sustained and unprecedented growth, driven by unprecedented factors, deviating from the structure of the typical four-year cycle tied to halving events. While the impact of these new entrants remains uncertain, their role in shaping the Bitcoin cycle carries some logic. In particular, demand from these sectors might help reduce downside volatility and establish a higher post-peak price floor compared to previous cycles. This outcome would depend on nation-states or corporations adopting long-term holding strategies, as indicated by Senator Cynthia Lummis' proposal for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Previous Bitcoin cycles were largely driven by individual retail investors. However, in this cycle, retail investors are set to take more of a backseat role as larger players move into the spotlight. The large-scale purchases by corporations and institutions likely decrease the market impact of retail investors. Yet individuals, while they may see a relative diminishment on the demand side, should not be overlooked on the supply side. This is because, according to analysis from sources like River Financial, individuals still hold the majority of Bitcoin. As prices reach certain levels, even some of the strongest hands may choose to offload a portion of their holdings to cash in for lifestyle upgrades.  On the other hand, the more individuals “HODL,” the greater the supply crunch will become.

Warning lights
The above analysis paints an optimistic picture for 2025; however, in the realm of Bitcoin, such optimism can often be deceptive. With some risks in the U.S. seemingly subdued following the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, what other risks might 2025 hold?

The greatest risk facing Bitcoin as we approach 2025 and beyond may be the threat of a major global recession or financial crisis, potentially sparked by instability within the global financial system. The recent unwinding of the yen carry trade caused Bitcoin's value to drop by approximately 20%, underscoring its sensitivity to liquidity contractions and price volatility. While this yen event was short-lived, a prolonged financial crisis similar to the Global Financial Crisis could drive a more severe and extended downturn for Bitcoin. With widespread job losses, both retail and institutional demand could evaporate. On the other hand, Bitcoin has a history of thriving in crises, especially during currency debasement, as witnessed in 2020, indicating that a global recession might reinforce its appeal.

The wider cryptocurrency space, including exchanges, has shown vulnerability to fraud and security failures in recent years. A lingering risk remains for the year ahead: could the collapse of a key player destabilise the market once again? Coinbase’s (COIN:US) role as a custodian for numerous institutions, including major ETF issuers like BlackRock and companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, has recently come under scrutiny, presenting an evolving concentration risk worth considering.

A recent analysis by The Defiant revealed that Coinbase custodies a substantial 11% of the total Bitcoin supply, roughly 2.275 million BTC. This could leave Coinbase vulnerable to potential nation-state pressure in future, similar to the US enforcement action under Executive Order 6102, which seized private gold in the 1930s. The centralisation of Bitcoin and crypto assets within a single entity is also concerning given the risks of hacking or technical failure. While the risks are very low, the potential fallout could have disastrous implications for Bitcoin.

Finally, the elephant in the room for next year is MicroStrategy. Its novel investment strategy and Michael Saylor's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin could pose significant risks if the price of Bitcoin plummets or the company’s approach falters. While BitMEX has indicated that forced liquidation is “highly unlikely” as of October 2024, they caution that “anything is possible.” Given the substantial amount of Bitcoin MicroStrategy holds, any issues could trigger a cascading effect across the broader ecosystem. Although the company managed to weather the last bear market, its rapid and dramatic accumulation of Bitcoin in recent times raises questions about its resilience in the face of future challenges. For better or worse, scrutiny and media attention on MicroStrategy and Saylor are likely to intensify as the current cycle unfolds.

Conclusion
The outlook for Bitcoin in 2025 suggests an action-packed year, with opportunities, challenges, and volatility ahead. As this article is published in early December, developments later in the month could still shape the 2025 outlook. Investors should stay updated on evolving factors, including policy changes and major market movements, to navigate the year effectively.

At its core, Bitcoin remains a constant, but it’s the world around it that will continue to evolve. As the Bitcoin community often says, "You can't change Bitcoin; Bitcoin changes you." Will 2025 see more individuals, companies, and even governments changed by Bitcoin?

Setting aside debates about its purpose or future, Bitcoin’s very existence challenges us to reconsider the economic, political, and social frameworks that we’ve long taken for granted. In a world where so much seems to be breaking down, perhaps a new constant is exactly what we need.
