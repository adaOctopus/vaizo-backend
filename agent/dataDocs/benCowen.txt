00:00:00.640 hey everyone and thanks for jumpping
00:00:01.880 back into the macroverse today we're
00:00:04.440 going to talk about the labor market and
00:00:06.520 of course the implications for Bitcoin
00:00:09.200 if you guys like the content make sure
00:00:10.719 you subscribe to the channel give video
00:00:12.120 a thumbs up and also check out the sale
00:00:14.320 on into the cryptus premium add into
00:00:16.760 Toth
00:00:18.039 cryptoverse we do this video about once
00:00:21.000 a month just when the labor market data
00:00:22.640 comes out this time I it was delayed by
00:00:25.199 a week so my apologies for getting it
00:00:27.400 out to you guys late but better late
00:00:29.840 than never um I guess the urgency wasn't
00:00:32.840 really there considering that not a
00:00:34.600 whole lot has changed in terms of the
00:00:37.040 labor market over the last few months
00:00:39.559 but just for completeness we will go
00:00:42.320 through the charts once again the
00:00:44.960 unemployment rate did increase slightly
00:00:48.440 back to
00:00:50.199 4.2% um so it you know it really hasn't
00:00:53.239 changed a whole lot over the last say
00:00:55.480 four or five months it it went from 4.3
00:00:58.039 down to 4.1 stayed at 41 then back up to
00:01:01.199 42 so it's kind of in that in between
00:01:04.720 Zone where you know ideally ideally the
00:01:08.320 unemployment rate does not continue to
00:01:10.560 go up Beyond 4.3 right that would be
00:01:13.119 sort of the ideal scenario and and that
00:01:16.000 hopefully the FED has pivoted in time to
00:01:19.920 avoid a continued uptrend in the
00:01:23.759 unemployment rate right that would be
00:01:25.200 the ideal
00:01:26.280 scenario with it going back up to
00:01:28.920 4.2 it does call that into question in
00:01:32.000 fact I believe we were only maybe about
00:01:33.960 7,000 jobs away from this being rounded
00:01:36.640 to
00:01:37.439 4.3% so it's just going to kick the can
00:01:40.520 down the road again and we'll see where
00:01:42.759 it comes in next month but hopefully
00:01:44.840 hopefully we'll see it sort of uh level
00:01:47.119 out if you apply a moving average to it
00:01:49.079 like a 3-month moving average you can
00:01:51.280 kind of see that it it it's done this
00:01:53.040 thing so far you know where it moves up
00:01:55.799 for a while and then it sort of cools
00:01:57.600 off for a little bit right last year it
00:02:00.600 started moving up in April and then it
00:02:02.719 started cooling off in Q4 and then you
00:02:05.680 can see here in 2024 it started moving
00:02:07.640 up again and then it's again cooling off
00:02:10.598 around that Q4 time frame so I guess the
00:02:13.440 question is well is it going to start
00:02:15.800 accelerating again once we get out into
00:02:19.000 2025 now you could look at this chart
00:02:22.200 and say Well when the unemployment rate
00:02:24.160 goes up you typically get a recession
00:02:27.440 but one of the things that's been
00:02:28.920 different so far
00:02:30.560 about the unemployment rate this cycle
00:02:32.879 is that the unemployment rate while it
00:02:35.000 has gone up it it's been more of a
00:02:37.360 controlled move up right it hasn't been
00:02:39.959 a a parabolic rise like what we've seen
00:02:43.120 in Prior recessions where for instance
00:02:45.400 the unemployment rate went from 39 to 4
00:02:49.400 to 41 to 42 you know to 43 and then just
00:02:53.280 kept on climbing basically month after
00:02:55.640 month after month now a few months ago a
00:02:59.239 few months ago ago when we saw that
00:03:02.000 briefly right we saw that briefly we
00:03:03.760 went 38 39 4 41 and then 43 that was
00:03:09.200 when Bitcoin started to get a little
00:03:12.799 concerned right this right here these
00:03:15.799 lower highs occurred while the
00:03:18.959 unemployment rate was going up in a
00:03:20.959 fairly steady fashion like that right so
00:03:23.400 if you just look to see where that
00:03:25.599 uptrend and the unemployment rate
00:03:27.519 occurred was right there and during that
00:03:30.519 uptrend in the unemployment rate that's
00:03:32.720 exactly when Bitcoin started to put in
00:03:35.360 you know that that lower high structure
00:03:37.280 but after the unemployment rate came
00:03:39.519 back down Bitcoin used that opportunity
00:03:42.680 to just shoot back up now one of the
00:03:45.000 things I've said before and I I stand by
00:03:47.360 this is that Bitcoin does not need a
00:03:50.159 reason to go up right just like the S&P
00:03:52.799 doesn't need a reason to go up the
00:03:55.200 markets just Trend up you know it's more
00:03:58.280 or less what the market what the markets
00:04:00.200 are are essentially designed to do um
00:04:03.000 you know when you have inflation when
00:04:04.599 you have money printing that money has
00:04:06.599 to find a home somewhere and it's going
00:04:08.959 to go to you know to the assets that
00:04:11.799 people want to you know want to invest
00:04:15.200 in right and and so risk assets at least
00:04:18.639 the blue chips among them don't need a
00:04:20.839 reason to go up they need a reason to go
00:04:23.199 down and you can see that there's two
00:04:26.120 main reasons that that Bitcoin can well
00:04:29.039 there's three but the there's two that
00:04:31.440 we can actually somewhat study the third
00:04:33.240 one's not really something that is is
00:04:35.160 something we can study per se the the
00:04:37.080 first one of course is if the
00:04:38.400 unemployment rate starts to go up right
00:04:40.600 if that starts to move up quickly then
00:04:43.680 that can cause Bitcoin to struggle okay
00:04:48.520 the other is when inflation goes up and
00:04:53.160 by the way this isn't just Bitcoin this
00:04:54.360 is the S&P as well right when inflation
00:04:56.680 goes up quickly that causes Bitcoin to
00:04:59.400 go down and the third thing of course is
00:05:01.639 just like you know black swans or
00:05:03.479 geopolitical events that no one really
00:05:05.680 has any business trying to predict
00:05:07.680 because they're essentially impossible
00:05:08.919 to predict anyway so why worry about
00:05:10.880 those sorts of things now here you can
00:05:14.560 see that the minute the unemployment
00:05:16.720 rate started to go down right the minute
00:05:19.479 it started to go down Bitcoin bottomed
00:05:22.919 out and then immediately shot up so this
00:05:26.440 is sort of proof that Bitcoin does not
00:05:28.800 need a reason
00:05:30.240 to go up but when the labor market gives
00:05:33.360 it a reason to go down it will listen
00:05:37.120 now we haven't seen that yet right and
00:05:38.680 we we just got one move
00:05:40.720 up um and it's not clear if that's going
00:05:44.759 to be a sustained Trend or not so it
00:05:47.680 could simply you know do something like
00:05:50.280 this where it it doesn't make a move up
00:05:52.759 right it might do something like that if
00:05:54.840 the unemployment rate continues to go up
00:05:58.280 right like that then you could see you
00:06:00.919 know sort of something like that repeat
00:06:02.639 itself potentially in uh 2025 so I would
00:06:06.880 I I would certainly keep an eye on that
00:06:08.960 but again it's one of those things where
00:06:12.319 as long as the unemployment rate is is
00:06:14.199 sort of below the Cycles High 4.3% then
00:06:17.680 Bitcoin will likely not be too concerned
00:06:20.680 about
00:06:21.560 it so that's the unemployment rate if
00:06:23.840 you go look at the unemployment level uh
00:06:25.919 you know it came in at at 7.14 million
00:06:28.880 so it did you know it is starting to
00:06:30.639 move back up here again that is a little
00:06:32.800 concerning but it it doesn't necessarily
00:06:34.520 mean that it has to continue its Ascent
00:06:36.960 again you could argue that one of the
00:06:38.880 reasons why risk assets have done so
00:06:41.680 well despite the unemployment level
00:06:43.720 increasing is you can see the clear
00:06:46.000 difference between this move and then
00:06:48.680 these sort of these parabolic moves
00:06:50.800 right the parabolic moves in the
00:06:52.639 unemployment level is sort of like once
00:06:54.599 it's beyond the control to sort of reain
00:06:57.280 in in the short term right as long as
00:06:59.759 it's sort of a controlled move then the
00:07:02.680 market really will not pay too close
00:07:04.759 attention to it now this is one of the
00:07:09.520 real reasons why um things have have
00:07:13.680 sort of just slow you know the the
00:07:15.280 markets will look at the labor market
00:07:16.960 but as long as it's not going up too
00:07:18.400 quickly and this is what you should look
00:07:20.280 at right look at Job losers you see this
00:07:24.599 you see it's it's been going up right
00:07:26.160 it's been going up since 2022 but it's
00:07:29.560 been a fairly steady climb it doesn't
00:07:32.800 look like what you got in recessions
00:07:36.319 where the unemployment rate just
00:07:38.759 accelerated right you see the difference
00:07:41.280 if you apply a moving average to it you
00:07:43.800 might be able to see what I'm talking
00:07:44.879 about right like the angle of attack
00:07:46.560 here is different than the angle of
00:07:49.360 attack here if any of you guys are
00:07:51.360 aerospace engineers or mechanical
00:07:53.000 engineers you've probably heard of that
00:07:54.479 terminology before right the angle of
00:07:55.879 attack and
00:07:57.440 so that I think is arguably
00:08:00.000 what the market is looking at and if you
00:08:01.360 look at at at new entrance to the labor
00:08:04.520 force that's arguably where a lot of the
00:08:07.560 unemployment level is coming from right
00:08:09.240 I mean if you look at new entrance to
00:08:10.759 the labor force that's what really looks
00:08:13.319 concerning right that if if I were to
00:08:15.080 look for like one big thing in this
00:08:17.680 labor market that seems concerning it
00:08:20.240 would be this chart right and again this
00:08:22.840 is new entrance to the labor force so
00:08:25.680 you know maybe people out of high school
00:08:27.120 people out of college but if you think
00:08:29.120 about
00:08:30.759 the the people with the most amount of
00:08:32.519 money that are going to move risk assets
00:08:34.599 are not the people typically that are
00:08:37.519 newly entering the labor market right
00:08:39.200 they're the people that have been in the
00:08:40.200 labor market for a long time and they
00:08:41.559 have money to spend okay so the new
00:08:44.399 entrance to the labor market potentially
00:08:46.760 don't influence the market nearly as
00:08:49.240 much um but you can see that this has
00:08:53.800 been moving up somewhat parabolically
00:08:56.839 and I think one of the reasons for this
00:08:59.640 one of the reasons that new entrance to
00:09:01.480 the labor force are struggling to find a
00:09:05.279 job is because hires are down right if
00:09:08.000 you go look at at highers which what we
00:09:10.760 were going to come to later anyways but
00:09:12.120 if you look at highers highers have been
00:09:14.399 dropping since 2022 right I mean you can
00:09:17.000 see they topped out here I guess there
00:09:18.680 was a spike back over here but they
00:09:19.880 really topped out in February 2022 one
00:09:22.279 month before the FED started to cut and
00:09:24.680 they've been trending down ever since um
00:09:27.600 so the reason why new entrance to the
00:09:30.160 labor force are having a hard time
00:09:31.800 finding a job is because people aren't
00:09:34.399 really hiring nearly as much as they
00:09:36.120 used to in fact the last
00:09:39.600 time that highers were this low other
00:09:43.360 than just a few months ago would have
00:09:45.519 been all the way back in 2017 right so
00:09:49.800 hiring is C except for the pandemic
00:09:51.880 right so hiring is is certainly
00:09:54.959 down but just because hiring is down
00:09:58.360 doesn't mean layoffs are up cuz if you
00:10:00.600 go look at layoffs and
00:10:02.839 discharges it hasn't been that bad as as
00:10:06.440 you know despite what you see and what
00:10:08.279 you
00:10:09.560 hear it really hasn't been that bad in
00:10:12.839 fact layoffs and discharges are actually
00:10:16.519 still below let's maybe let's add a um
00:10:20.000 let's add a a moving average here maybe
00:10:22.560 a 3mon moving average they're actually
00:10:24.880 still below you know what we saw for the
00:10:28.079 better part of a decade
00:10:30.399 right so yes I mean layoffs have
00:10:31.920 increased some but the point was this
00:10:34.839 was all sort of excess like a region we
00:10:37.440 don't normally find oursel in so a lot
00:10:39.839 of the excess in the labor market has
00:10:41.680 gotten trimmed off especially in the
00:10:43.360 tech sector and we've Now sort of just
00:10:47.000 started to get back to what is normal
00:10:50.680 okay we've just started to get back to
00:10:51.839 what is
00:10:53.639 normal now let's go back to what we were
00:10:56.240 talking about so we have the
00:10:57.560 unemployment level we which we just
00:10:59.639 talked about and you can even sort of
00:11:01.720 isolate this into say 16 to 19 year olds
00:11:04.360 and see that that has really been moving
00:11:06.680 up younger people even 20 to 24 year
00:11:09.560 olds uh not it doesn't look as bad so
00:11:12.000 it's really the younger people 16 to 19
00:11:14.639 year olds the unemployment rates really
00:11:16.079 moving up but if you look at 25 to 54
00:11:18.519 year olds I mean it's moving up but it
00:11:20.519 doesn't look nearly as bad as it does
00:11:22.880 for say the 16 to 19 year olds and then
00:11:25.040 if you look at people over the age of 55
00:11:27.800 yes it's been going up but it's still
00:11:30.279 been a relatively slow um angle attack
00:11:34.200 right or a slow a slow pace higher so
00:11:36.639 going back to the unemployment level by
00:11:39.079 reason for unemployment um we obviously
00:11:41.680 looked at new entrance to the labor
00:11:43.480 force that has been one of the more
00:11:45.160 concerning ones reentrance to labor
00:11:47.360 force has been going out but doesn't
00:11:49.040 look quite as bad as new entrance to
00:11:50.920 labor force if you look at people
00:11:52.880 leaving their
00:11:54.200 job not really a lot of signal there if
00:11:56.360 I'm being completely honest um let's
00:11:58.760 look at persons who completed temporary
00:12:02.079 jobs slowly going up but again it
00:12:04.959 doesn't look quite like what you saw
00:12:07.000 back over here at least not yet right
00:12:09.519 that doesn't mean it can't happen now
00:12:11.440 permanent job losers starting to move up
00:12:14.680 right if you look at a year-over-year
00:12:16.360 change it's been positive for a while
00:12:19.079 but this might be one of the best ways
00:12:20.920 to sort of show you why this so far has
00:12:24.880 been a lot different from prior
00:12:26.480 recessions because it's been a more
00:12:28.920 could controlled move up right you know
00:12:31.720 in terms of year-over-year percentage
00:12:33.560 change it's just been around you know 10
00:12:36.040 to 20% whereas in the financial crisis
00:12:39.160 it went all the way up to
00:12:41.360 177% and in the recession it went up to
00:12:44.440 150% so you probably can see the
00:12:47.199 difference right you can probably see
00:12:50.079 what I'm talking about and and how it
00:12:51.959 looks different from those those prior
00:12:54.199 recessions even the uh the pandemic
00:12:56.199 recession right you can see how the
00:12:57.480 year-over-year change shot up a lot but
00:12:59.760 we just simply haven't seen that yet and
00:13:02.160 so because you know there's been this
00:13:04.639 sort of loosening in the labor market it
00:13:07.399 obviously causes people to worry and
00:13:09.120 then risk ass outs just as always they
00:13:11.240 climb the wall of worry until they have
00:13:12.680 a sufficient reason not to do so and
00:13:14.639 until the labor market really starts to
00:13:16.519 show weakness then you know risk assets
00:13:19.360 will likely continue to do that so if
00:13:21.160 you go look at the unemployment rate per
00:13:22.880 state I I tend to just go through a
00:13:25.639 few we always check in with Alabama
00:13:28.519 because it is is uh alphabetically it is
00:13:30.480 first so we'll go see what Alabama's
00:13:32.040 doing unemployment rate at 2.9% so not
00:13:35.199 really that bad uh let's go check in
00:13:37.079 with California it actually dropped a
00:13:39.079 little bit over the last couple of
00:13:40.120 months and it started to go back up
00:13:41.279 again you can see here it dropped in
00:13:42.839 early 2024 it's starting to go back up
00:13:45.120 once again unemployment rate in
00:13:46.279 California is up to
00:13:48.600 5.4% uh I'd like to check in with
00:13:50.839 Colorado actually because it it's been
00:13:53.240 steadily going up but you see you know
00:13:55.360 you see how it looks kind of different
00:13:57.160 than these moves where it just acceler
00:13:59.440 up a lot quicker it's been more of a
00:14:01.240 slower move
00:14:03.440 up sorry I didn't mean to click on that
00:14:07.279 um Florida unemployment rated in Florida
00:14:09.959 has been flat at 3.3% for a little while
00:14:12.600 uh the District of Colombia it's been
00:14:14.920 moving up somewhat aggressively it
00:14:16.639 steadied out a little bit last couple of
00:14:17.959 months let's go check in with Georgia
00:14:20.199 that one had been relatively flat for a
00:14:22.120 long time it started moving up in April
00:14:23.800 from 31 all the way up to 36 it's been
00:14:26.320 stalled sort of about 36 for a little
00:14:28.639 while I always like to check in with New
00:14:31.199 York and Texas New York's unemployment
00:14:33.839 rate still relatively low all things
00:14:35.440 considered I mean at
00:14:36.920 4.4% um it's still you know lower than
00:14:39.759 it has been for most of its history
00:14:42.279 Texas still relatively low at
00:14:45.360 4.1% and then let's check in with um
00:14:50.600 Wisconsin again this is one of those
00:14:52.440 states where it's relatively low right
00:14:54.839 only
00:14:56.240 2.9% okay so some of the states look a
00:15:00.480 little weaker some of them look a little
00:15:02.040 stronger so if you go to the number of
00:15:03.920 states where the unemployment rate is
00:15:05.519 rising over the last month you can see
00:15:08.600 you know there's been sort of these
00:15:09.920 these
00:15:10.920 surges and you know this was in
00:15:12.959 September 2022 this was in September
00:15:15.199 2023 this was in August 2024 this was
00:15:18.399 September
00:15:20.240 2024 so you can see that you know I mean
00:15:24.600 it it's it's moving up a little bit here
00:15:26.519 into October but it it's actually
00:15:29.000 essentially you know this is at 22
00:15:30.920 October 2024 in October 2023 it was at
00:15:33.839 24 and October of 2022 it was at 18 so
00:15:37.920 you know it there has been some
00:15:40.040 softening but we haven't seen you know
00:15:42.959 we haven't really seen these Peaks go up
00:15:45.279 and stay higher just yet right they all
00:15:47.800 just sort of beat they're all relatively
00:15:49.360 shortlived now you could look at over
00:15:51.480 three months and over 6 months probably
00:15:54.079 6 months is the way to look is the way
00:15:55.600 to look at it so if you look at it over
00:15:57.240 6 months you can see that was a a an
00:15:59.880 uptrend in the number of states with a
00:16:01.440 rising unemployment rate in 2022 and
00:16:04.040 then another uptrend in in 2023 and then
00:16:07.120 we've arguably had another uptrend in
00:16:09.199 2024 although that it was a higher low
00:16:12.600 but it hasn't put in a higher high just
00:16:15.759 yeah now we can look at a map right so
00:16:18.040 if you're you know if you're living in
00:16:19.120 one of the states and you're just
00:16:21.360 curious you know how does it look in in
00:16:23.399 your state uh let me go ahead and reload
00:16:25.639 this see if I can get this to load um
00:16:28.040 now you can see these these are the
00:16:29.199 states where the unemployment rate went
00:16:30.560 went up over the last month here is over
00:16:32.199 the last 3 months and here is over the
00:16:34.000 last 6 months and if you play this
00:16:37.160 through you know starting in
00:16:39.560 1976 and you look see these these areas
00:16:42.319 down here these are prior recessions
00:16:44.240 when you get to those recessions you'll
00:16:45.759 basically see the entire country have an
00:16:48.639 unemployment rate in these states that
00:16:50.480 are higher than they were six months ago
00:16:52.440 right so that was the 1980 1981
00:16:54.600 recession that you just saw um there's
00:16:57.240 been some scares like in the mid 19 80s
00:16:59.279 but you never really saw the entire
00:17:01.040 country uh see that rise in unemployment
00:17:03.800 rate now we're starting to get into the
00:17:04.880 90s where there was a recession right
00:17:06.720 there you see how it affected most of
00:17:08.559 the
00:17:09.959 country and then throughout the 1990s
00:17:12.359 it's relatively clean maybe there was
00:17:13.959 something in 1995 1996 but again it
00:17:16.400 didn't affect the whole country um I I
00:17:18.760 believe there was an unal curve back
00:17:20.319 then too very briefly and there you saw
00:17:22.599 1998 1999 a little worry and then the
00:17:24.799 recession actually hit in 2001 right
00:17:27.039 where it was the whole country and then
00:17:28.520 now you get out into 2002 as the
00:17:30.440 recession finally ended um and then now
00:17:32.799 in a few seconds we're going to get to
00:17:34.240 the financial crisis where you can see
00:17:36.960 the whole country was in fact affected
00:17:39.799 that was the financial crisis and then
00:17:42.160 now you get out into the 2010s where
00:17:44.360 it's relatively okay there's a few
00:17:46.240 moments here and there where you'll see
00:17:47.600 the unemployment rate rise in some of
00:17:49.000 the states um but for the most part it
00:17:52.039 it was relatively okay there was a scare
00:17:53.799 in 2016 I remember um and then obviously
00:17:56.720 we're we're approaching the pandemic
00:17:58.280 here relative ly soon that was 2018 now
00:18:00.919 this is the pandemic and then now this
00:18:02.720 is 2021 here's 2022 you're seeing a
00:18:05.200 little weakness 2023 some weakness and
00:18:08.080 now we're in 2024 so there's weakness
00:18:11.000 there but the thing is is like you're
00:18:13.120 still not seeing it affect the entire
00:18:15.679 country it's getting close and you have
00:18:18.120 to remember the labor market as it
00:18:20.720 weakens it's sort of like a disease it
00:18:22.799 can affect you know certain States and
00:18:25.559 then it'll expand
00:18:27.320 outward so I mean again like it it is
00:18:29.679 affecting a lot of the states right now
00:18:31.840 but there's still Pockets where things
00:18:33.960 are okay right and even the states where
00:18:36.320 the unemployment rate is going up it's
00:18:37.880 not nearly as high as it was in some of
00:18:40.360 those prior recessions so here we have
00:18:42.559 alternative unemployment rate measures
00:18:44.480 this is the U U1 which means greater
00:18:47.240 than 15 weeks unemployed that one is
00:18:49.880 starting to move up again um so I would
00:18:52.120 certainly want to watch that when it's
00:18:53.960 basically risen from 1.1% in 2023 to
00:18:57.840 1.7% % uh now and I mean you can see
00:19:01.440 that it it actually is starting to move
00:19:03.039 up some people not in the labor force I
00:19:05.159 don't really care that much about this
00:19:06.240 indicator but I'm throwing it on there
00:19:07.840 just in case you guys are interested
00:19:09.880 employment statistics labor force
00:19:11.440 participation rate I'm not that
00:19:12.880 interested in this one but I'm just
00:19:13.880 throwing it up there for completeness um
00:19:17.320 civilian Force labor a civilian Labor
00:19:19.559 Force Level uh just for completeness in
00:19:21.720 case you want to look at it it is
00:19:23.760 starting to drop here um but you know I
00:19:27.520 don't I don't really have a strong
00:19:28.440 opinion on this employment level so this
00:19:30.320 is an interesting one so this is the
00:19:32.280 establishment survey versus the
00:19:34.559 household survey so the establishment
00:19:36.240 survey if you were to look at a
00:19:37.840 year-over-year percentage change still
00:19:40.880 looks relatively okay right I mean it's
00:19:42.880 at
00:19:44.280 1.45% if you were to go look at when the
00:19:47.120 financial crisis recession started it it
00:19:50.000 it started when the year-over-year
00:19:51.520 change here about hit went below 1% okay
00:19:54.440 if you go look at the dot recession the
00:19:57.559 recession started when it went below 1%
00:19:59.640 as well so right now it's at
00:20:02.559 1.45% but keep in mind it's basically
00:20:05.600 been in the 1% range
00:20:09.120 um since October of 2023 right it's been
00:20:12.039 just slowly going down okay so there's
00:20:14.720 no telling how long it will it will
00:20:16.360 actually take before it goes below one
00:20:19.200 now one of the things that's been
00:20:20.960 interesting this cycle is that there's
00:20:23.280 been a Divergence between the
00:20:24.840 establishment survey and the household
00:20:26.880 survey if you look at the household
00:20:28.400 survey
00:20:29.280 you can see that it's actually really
00:20:30.679 started to Plateau here and if you look
00:20:33.039 at a year-over-year percentage change it
00:20:36.480 has in fact gone negative right and
00:20:39.200 historically when it goes negative it's
00:20:41.960 not a good thing right it it really
00:20:43.960 hasn't been historically but there are
00:20:46.120 some exceptions for instance right here
00:20:48.360 you can see that it went negative in
00:20:50.400 March of
00:20:51.520 1952 but the recession didn't occur
00:20:55.080 until July of
00:20:56.880 1953 right so it was still a year away
00:21:00.480 um in in that case so it's again you
00:21:04.200 really have to see the weakness sort of
00:21:06.159 persist throughout the entire country
00:21:08.600 for it to really um make a difference
00:21:11.039 now one of the things I'd like to
00:21:12.919 do and I've talked about this before we
00:21:15.520 have a workbench over here and what we
00:21:17.600 can do is we can look at um if I can
00:21:20.960 find it I think I I think I did this
00:21:23.039 before employment surveys right so these
00:21:26.080 are the two employment surveys okay and
00:21:30.880 um let me so these are the two
00:21:33.840 employment surveys right so you can see
00:21:36.640 that one the household survey has
00:21:39.200 leveled off and it's starting to go down
00:21:40.679 a little bit The Establishment survey is
00:21:43.159 still going up okay
00:21:46.279 now historically they tend to move
00:21:49.480 together right they tend to move
00:21:51.360 together so this is somewhat of an
00:21:55.320 anomaly if you take if you look at the
00:21:58.679 division of these two right you can see
00:22:02.840 that it's at a new
00:22:05.000 low right it's on a new low but what I'd
00:22:07.720 really like to do is not divide them I
00:22:09.720 would like to take the average okay so
00:22:12.120 if we take the average of these two you
00:22:14.559 get that now let's hide everything else
00:22:19.120 and why don't we use the average to tell
00:22:22.320 us what's going on right so rather than
00:22:25.279 project our own bias right rather than
00:22:27.559 say oh it has to be the establishment
00:22:29.960 survey that's right or oh it has to be
00:22:31.400 the household survey that's right if we
00:22:33.039 wait them the same and take the average
00:22:35.159 maybe that's a better way to do it and
00:22:37.080 in this case you can see that it is
00:22:39.080 slowing down but you haven't necessarily
00:22:42.279 seen that entire Plateau yet right the
00:22:45.320 plateau is where things become
00:22:47.799 concerning okay now and I'm not saying
00:22:49.919 we're not entering it now it's possible
00:22:52.520 but remember this takes place over years
00:22:56.240 that's I think one of the biggest
00:22:57.279 disconnects between you know sort of
00:22:59.120 macroanalysis like this and and people
00:23:01.840 want to know what's happening in the
00:23:02.799 market ISS guys this stuff takes years
00:23:04.559 to play out and a lot of people wanted
00:23:06.480 to play out over the span of a few weeks
00:23:08.679 that's just not going to
00:23:10.279 happen so you know these these business
00:23:12.960 Cycles just absolutely take years and
00:23:15.000 you can see when they start to level off
00:23:17.200 it can still take a while before you you
00:23:19.559 actually see that drop um remember I
00:23:21.559 mean just looking at this chart you're
00:23:23.279 you're looking at a chart that goes back
00:23:24.919 to 1948 so you're talking about
00:23:27.320 essentially 80 years years of data on
00:23:29.520 this chart and you get frustrated if it
00:23:31.919 doesn't play out by next Tuesday right
00:23:33.760 that's your problem not mine okay this
00:23:35.799 is the the way the business cycle works
00:23:38.440 um so let's continue on here's non-farm
00:23:42.240 private payrolls employment level this
00:23:43.960 one still looks relatively okay in terms
00:23:46.320 of a year-over-year percentage change
00:23:47.960 it's still about
00:23:49.480 1.4% uh total temporary Help Services
00:23:52.159 has just been dropping ever since 2022
00:23:54.760 the year-over a-year percentage change
00:23:56.520 though looks different from the fin
00:23:58.440 fincial crisis in theom recessions where
00:24:00.279 it really went parabolic and this
00:24:01.919 dropped year of year by about -
00:24:04.320 20%-30% almost so far this cycle the
00:24:07.480 lowest it's been is about Nega
00:24:09.440 8% so you can see the sort of difference
00:24:12.080 between this drop and the drops we saw
00:24:14.120 over here and it could be due to the
00:24:15.440 rise over here was a lot higher I mean
00:24:17.360 it went all the way up to almost 43% so
00:24:19.520 a lot of this is just kind of getting
00:24:20.919 rid of some of the excess
00:24:24.440 right multiple job
00:24:27.120 holders has been trending higher which
00:24:30.559 you know not really uh something you you
00:24:34.000 know I mean obviously it's not really
00:24:35.039 the best thing in the world if a lot of
00:24:36.440 people have to work multiple jobs but
00:24:39.080 job postings on indeed uh has continued
00:24:42.000 to slowly go down hopefully it's
00:24:44.120 leveling out here a little bit if you
00:24:45.640 look at a year-over-year percentage
00:24:47.000 change you know it's been negative for a
00:24:49.039 while you know negative 10 to 20% or so
00:24:52.720 um for for quite a long period of time
00:24:55.039 you can even this is total you can even
00:24:56.520 break it down by category you could look
00:24:58.039 at listings and I don't you know I mean
00:25:00.720 there's been some drops before uh you
00:25:03.039 can see here there was a pretty big drop
00:25:04.840 in November into you know early December
00:25:08.080 and you're kind of seeing a big drop
00:25:09.600 here by by new listings and this kind of
00:25:11.520 goes back to what we were talking about
00:25:12.480 earlier right new graduates like new
00:25:15.640 graduates are having a hard time finding
00:25:17.559 a job because hires are down and one of
00:25:19.720 the reasons hires are down is because
00:25:21.720 there's some uncertainty as to what's
00:25:23.120 going to happen and also you know it
00:25:25.600 could I mean obviously job openings are
00:25:27.279 down um and it could just be that you
00:25:29.640 know a lot of companies are waiting for
00:25:31.399 looser and looser monetary to monetary
00:25:33.440 policy to come in before they really
00:25:35.240 start to expand and we are getting rate
00:25:36.760 Cuts so there is going to be some effect
00:25:38.399 but again it's a delayed
00:25:40.760 effect can look at uh Banking and
00:25:43.120 finance job openings on indeed it's
00:25:46.559 actually below the pre-pandemic level
00:25:48.919 but it's just been trending there for a
00:25:50.240 little while um we could look at
00:25:53.000 Insurance uh that's actually been going
00:25:55.159 up recently job postings on on indeed um
00:25:59.919 electrical
00:26:03.640 engineering Physicians and surgeons well
00:26:06.679 above the prepandemic levels well above
00:26:09.760 all right here's the employment to
00:26:11.159 population ratio if you look at a
00:26:13.279 year-over year percentage change
00:26:15.279 year-over-year change it is in fact now
00:26:17.080 negative job openings so let's go take a
00:26:19.679 look at job
00:26:20.919 openings it's been on a downtrend for a
00:26:23.039 while right but again this is just
00:26:25.039 getting rid of a lot of the excess that
00:26:26.600 was created after all the money printing
00:26:28.320 during the pandemic and but you can see
00:26:29.919 that job openings have essentially
00:26:31.559 returned to their pre-pandemic highs
00:26:34.320 okay job openings topped in March of
00:26:37.120 2022 when the FED started to cut so
00:26:40.640 hopefully they bottomed in September
00:26:43.240 when the fed or sorry when the FED
00:26:44.520 started to raise rates in March 2022
00:26:46.080 that was when the FED started to raise
00:26:47.120 rates now they've put in a bottom in
00:26:49.159 September 2024 when the FED started to
00:26:50.880 cut rates let's just see if that
00:26:52.600 actually is the bottom or if it
00:26:54.080 continues to go
00:26:56.200 lower the job quits let's just go look
00:26:58.919 at the job quits rate it actually went
00:27:01.000 up recently which is a good thing I mean
00:27:02.520 it's a good thing if people are willing
00:27:04.840 to quit their jobs it implies they're
00:27:06.480 able to find new jobs or they have you
00:27:07.960 know a reason to quit and they don't
00:27:09.159 feel like they need to keep their job
00:27:10.960 obviously you know you don't really want
00:27:12.880 to see this go down when you see it go
00:27:14.600 down it just means people are not as
00:27:16.360 optimistic about finding a new job
00:27:17.799 therefore they're unwilling to quit
00:27:18.880 their current
00:27:20.000 job so we'll see if this recent move up
00:27:23.120 and the job quits rate is is a more
00:27:24.880 durable Trend or if it's just another
00:27:26.480 Spike you know we've seen some spikes
00:27:28.559 before then then just came right back
00:27:30.320 down the following month uh layoffs and
00:27:32.559 discharges as I mentioned earlier still
00:27:34.320 relatively low initial claims is what
00:27:36.720 you really should look at I think
00:27:38.039 initial claims I've mentioned before
00:27:39.919 until it gets into the 300K range it's
00:27:42.080 really not recessionary right now it's a
00:27:45.120 242,000 a little bit of an uptick this
00:27:47.240 last month um you know if you go back
00:27:49.679 and look at what happened in in December
00:27:51.679 of 200 uh
00:27:54.600 2023 so December 2023
00:27:59.600 you can see it wasn't really getting
00:28:00.960 that that same Spike so I I'm curious as
00:28:04.600 to as to what's happening there because
00:28:07.120 last year you know if you apply say like
00:28:08.799 a 3-we moving average last
00:28:11.559 year it got I mean it did get a little
00:28:13.880 bit of a move up here into
00:28:17.240 November and then it went down into the
00:28:20.640 beginning of the year here it's starting
00:28:23.080 to move up um at a time where last year
00:28:25.960 it didn't so maybe let's go look at the
00:28:27.519 year before is just see if maybe last
00:28:29.120 year was an anomaly if you go look at
00:28:31.519 December of uh 2023 or sorry 2022 you
00:28:35.840 because it was a little spike in
00:28:37.240 November and then in December it it sort
00:28:40.399 of leveled out at around
00:28:42.240 212,000 and then it came back down so
00:28:44.600 let's keep an eye on initial claims if
00:28:46.320 that continues to go up it could be
00:28:48.720 concerning but again I don't think it's
00:28:50.159 that concerning until it hits 300K okay
00:28:53.559 once you see it print 300K it's probably
00:28:56.320 something to start paying a little bit
00:28:57.640 more attention
00:28:59.120 too this is initial claims per state
00:29:02.320 obviously it's not really that exciting
00:29:03.679 but I'd like to look at the initial
00:29:04.880 claims normalized by population
00:29:07.360 obviously it's getting a um you know up
00:29:09.679 up in here it's uh it's getting a little
00:29:12.760 high but it it tends to do this at the
00:29:14.320 end of the year right if you look at
00:29:15.480 like December 2023 it looked like that
00:29:17.720 December 2022 looked like that so it
00:29:20.159 might be getting a little spreading a
00:29:21.480 little bit but it still isn't really the
00:29:23.039 same down over here in in the South uh
00:29:26.320 you could look at continue claim s
00:29:28.640 continue claims are still you know
00:29:30.519 they're slowly trending up if you look
00:29:32.159 at like a seven we moving average but
00:29:34.840 still not what you not what you've seen
00:29:37.360 during prior recessions uh here's the
00:29:40.039 continued claims map normalized by
00:29:42.039 population in case you're curious what
00:29:43.519 it looks like and here is the number of
00:29:46.320 states where the percentage year of a
00:29:47.799 year continued claim claims is Rising by
00:29:50.360 at least say 10% um there was a spike in
00:29:55.399 December uh or sorry late 2023 but
00:29:58.760 recently it's it's it's trended down a
00:30:01.600 good deal since then so we'll keep an
00:30:04.039 eye on that as well highers as I
00:30:06.000 mentioned previously it's dropped a
00:30:08.200 considerable amount we could look at a
00:30:10.080 few of these labor indices here's the
00:30:11.720 Kansas City fed labor market conditions
00:30:13.519 index continues to drop but still above
00:30:16.440 zero okay it's currently at
00:30:19.159 0419 uh here's the Kansas City fed labor
00:30:22.039 market conditions index the momentum
00:30:25.360 indicator and then you can also go look
00:30:27.679 at at some of these
00:30:31.559 um what I want to look at the uh some of
00:30:34.600 these other things so you have the
00:30:35.640 smooth recession probabilities so as of
00:30:38.120 December the probability that United
00:30:40.080 States was in a recession is only
00:30:42.640 1.48% so still relatively low uh or
00:30:45.760 sorry that's as of so we was updated in
00:30:47.519 December but it's for October so the
00:30:49.799 probability that the US was in a
00:30:51.240 recession in October of 2024 is only
00:30:55.000 1.48% okay so still a relatively low
00:30:57.279 number um the Som Ru recession indicator
00:31:00.039 it did trigger a couple months ago now
00:31:02.600 it's kind of untriggered again um so
00:31:06.000 that's a good thing here's the Som rule
00:31:08.399 recession indicator per state right so
00:31:10.519 you can see some states it triggered and
00:31:12.080 then it
00:31:13.039 untriggered here's the number of states
00:31:15.120 where the Som Ru triggered it had a move
00:31:18.120 higher up to around 21 all the way up to
00:31:21.000 22 it's dropped back down to 15 and then
00:31:24.279 recently it went back up to 17 as of
00:31:27.200 October
00:31:28.760 here's a map of the states where the Su
00:31:30.840 rule has triggered so it's kind of like
00:31:34.279 this band across the middle of the
00:31:35.919 United States where it seems like a lot
00:31:38.000 of it has in fact triggered and if you
00:31:40.159 go back to sort of last year at this
00:31:43.320 time it looks like that now it looks
00:31:45.799 like this so again what do recessions
00:31:48.200 look like they look like
00:31:50.399 that like like this you know here's the
00:31:54.440 1990s right where it's like the whole
00:31:56.320 country practically right now it's it's
00:31:58.919 parts of the country and that might
00:32:00.760 explain why sentiment is so you know um
00:32:06.080 different right A lot of people they
00:32:07.720 they feel like things are bad and other
00:32:09.559 people like what are you talking about
00:32:10.600 things are great maybe it's because
00:32:12.720 where they are things are bad but where
00:32:15.120 the other person is things are great
00:32:16.799 right I mean you don't always have to
00:32:18.000 have the same conditions in every state
00:32:20.360 or even in any every city within a state
00:32:23.279 it can vary a lot uh if you look at the
00:32:26.480 the real GDP recession indicator it's
00:32:28.559 still relatively low the composite
00:32:30.440 leading indicator looks relatively okay
00:32:33.039 I mean it's still trending up it looked
00:32:35.000 like it was starting to Peak here in mid
00:32:37.639 2024 and then it just started to
00:32:39.679 accelerate once again
00:32:42.320 um The National Financial conditions
00:32:45.559 index still dropping uh here's here's
00:32:48.639 one of the interesting ones the
00:32:49.519 coincident economic activity index uh
00:32:51.919 I've looked at this one a good amount
00:32:53.720 the year-over-year percentage change on
00:32:55.480 this is
00:32:56.559 2.55% when the financial crisis
00:32:58.799 recession started this indicator was
00:33:00.880 below 2% when the recession started it
00:33:04.200 was when this indicator was at 2.2 right
00:33:07.559 now it's at 2.5 during the 1990s when it
00:33:10.720 triggered it was when this one hit 2.6
00:33:13.399 so you know it is getting into you know
00:33:16.559 some interesting territory but that
00:33:18.360 doesn't mean it immediately has to
00:33:19.880 accelerate down but it certainly one to
00:33:21.519 keep an eye on here's also the economic
00:33:23.720 policy uncertainty index it did get a
00:33:26.360 bit of a spike going into the it came
00:33:28.440 back down and now it's starting to go
00:33:29.840 back up a little bit so that's kind of
00:33:31.000 an interesting one to keep a look at
00:33:32.519 keep you know keep an eye on as
00:33:35.840 well I think that's it oh there's one
00:33:38.440 more uh job openings per unemployment
00:33:43.559 level right it's basically a little
00:33:46.200 below the pre-pandemic LI uh the the
00:33:48.760 pre- pandemic level um this is
00:33:51.760 essentially the number of job openings
00:33:53.240 per unemployed worker right so it's
00:33:54.960 still technically above one right 1
00:33:58.919 Point the most recent reading is 1.11 so
00:34:03.080 technically according to this
00:34:06.360 there's 1.11 job openings for every
00:34:10.040 person looking for a
00:34:11.839 job whether you want to believe that or
00:34:13.679 not it's up to you right and I don't
00:34:15.199 need a thousand comments telling me why
00:34:17.040 are you trusting the data guys this is
00:34:18.839 what the FED uses and this is what the
00:34:21.239 FED uses to decide what their policy is
00:34:23.520 going to be so whether you believe it or
00:34:25.560 not this is what's used to to make these
00:34:28.480 you know sort of determinations as to
00:34:29.918 what the fed's actually going to do
00:34:31.359 speaking of what the fed's actually
00:34:32.839 going to
00:34:34.760 do we go take a look there is almost a
00:34:37.918 97% chance they're going to cut rates in
00:34:40.918 December to get us to 4 and a half% um
00:34:45.159 and it looks like there's a pretty good
00:34:47.679 chance by January they're going to just
00:34:50.359 keep rates at that level okay so let's
00:34:53.639 see what they do normally within about a
00:34:56.280 week or so the markets PR locked in on
00:34:58.720 what the actual outcome's going to be
00:35:01.200 something drastic I imagine would have
00:35:02.800 to happen for them not to cut at this
00:35:04.200 point or if they just throw us a
00:35:05.280 complete curveball I've seen a lot of
00:35:07.160 people say well if if all these meme
00:35:09.040 coins are pumping why do they need to
00:35:10.960 cut rates but again mem coins pumping
00:35:15.079 you know that's you know they're not
00:35:16.480 make they're not basing their policy on
00:35:18.320 that right I mean that that stuff is
00:35:20.079 going to do what it's going to do and
00:35:21.359 there's excess
00:35:22.359 liquidity I think you have to consider
00:35:24.320 they're looking at the labor market
00:35:25.760 where they see certain things like they
00:35:28.119 see that the unemployment rate is
00:35:29.760 trending higher and they want to make
00:35:31.040 sure it doesn't continue to Trend higher
00:35:33.040 so uh they will likely cut rates what's
00:35:36.440 interesting is that this meeting is
00:35:38.599 actually on December 18th but I believe
00:35:41.599 you know there there's a there's a more
00:35:43.359 important meeting that day and that's
00:35:45.040 the bank of Japan um because the bank of
00:35:47.599 Japan is arguably going to do the
00:35:50.240 opposite of the FED not necessarily in
00:35:54.480 December um but if you go look at the um
00:35:59.319 at Japan interest
00:36:04.079 rates so let me see if I can get Japan
00:36:07.640 interest rates onto this chart so yeah
00:36:10.960 if you look at Japan interest rates
00:36:12.800 they've been raising rates because
00:36:14.319 inflation is starting to become you know
00:36:16.520 something they're concerned about um so
00:36:19.160 they're raising rates while the uh the
00:36:21.200 FED is lowering rates and the reason I
00:36:23.119 bring this up is because the last two
00:36:25.599 times the bank of Japan raised rates
00:36:27.800 there was a correction in the crypto
00:36:29.200 markets right so the the the bank of
00:36:31.359 Japan raise rates in in in March let's
00:36:34.720 switch this over to a monthly so we can
00:36:36.640 tell a little bit easier right they rais
00:36:38.400 rates in March and then obviously
00:36:39.880 Bitcoin we saw a correction in April and
00:36:42.839 they rais rates in July and then we got
00:36:45.160 the the correction in August so you know
00:36:48.680 I I think the markets right now are
00:36:50.680 assuming are suggesting there's only a
00:36:52.560 30% chance the bank of Japan's going to
00:36:54.480 raise rates and um and December so if
00:36:58.560 they don't raise rates that would be a
00:37:00.079 good thing for risk assets if they do
00:37:02.200 raise rates that would probably be a bad
00:37:03.720 thing but right now the markets are
00:37:05.240 saying a 30% chance they raise rates
00:37:08.000 meaning there's like a 70% chance they
00:37:09.839 don't raise rates regardless if the if
00:37:12.000 they don't raise rates in December
00:37:14.040 there's a really high chance they'll
00:37:15.800 raise rates in January now the reason I
00:37:18.880 mentioned that is because often times
00:37:21.960 Bitcoin actually does get Corrections in
00:37:24.680 January of post having years right if
00:37:26.800 you look at
00:37:28.040 January of 2021 Bitcoin got a correction
00:37:31.599 to the tune of 31% if you look at
00:37:34.319 January of 2017 Bitcoin got a or sorry
00:37:37.920 that was yeah 2017 Bitcoin got almost a
00:37:40.240 40% correction but again that doesn't
00:37:43.240 mean that it has to correct to a lower
00:37:45.040 price than it is now um you know if if
00:37:47.720 we're if we're
00:37:49.599 here if that's where we are right now
00:37:52.000 even if there is a correction it might
00:37:53.440 just be to a higher low than we are
00:37:55.680 today um even if November of of 2016
00:37:59.880 right it did go up and then we got a
00:38:01.520 correction but it wasn't to a lower
00:38:03.520 level so that's something to consider so
00:38:05.119 I would say if the bank of Japan raises
00:38:07.440 rates in December then it might be a
00:38:11.560 headwind for risk asset but remember
00:38:14.000 even when they raise rates in in April
00:38:16.640 and July or sorry in March and July the
00:38:18.880 actual correction by risk assets didn't
00:38:21.000 come until the following month right
00:38:23.119 they didn't come until the following
00:38:24.200 month um so even if they were to raise
00:38:26.280 rates in December the market might not
00:38:28.480 feel that effect until January okay so
00:38:32.760 just keep that in mind um for now
00:38:35.680 obviously the next unemployment rate
00:38:37.119 readings are not going to be for a few
00:38:38.760 more weeks so Bitcoin is is certainly
00:38:41.960 trying to put a new all-time highs once
00:38:43.720 again last cycle the big move came the
00:38:48.000 week of December 14th which would
00:38:50.480 essentially be next week um if you look
00:38:54.440 at 2016
00:38:58.079 when you can see that there was a big
00:39:00.160 move the week of December
00:39:02.319 19th which would again be like you know
00:39:04.920 next
00:39:05.760 week or the week after okay
00:39:09.800 so it's interesting how there's this
00:39:14.520 seasonality that continues to play out
00:39:16.839 and how you can even correlate these
00:39:19.079 macro events to Corrections in the
00:39:22.040 cryptoverse but again you know there's
00:39:24.160 always going to be something to worry
00:39:25.240 about markets like to climb the wall of
00:39:26.960 worry
00:39:28.000 um and that's what they're going to do
00:39:29.920 more than likely until the labor market
00:39:33.160 gives them a reason not to do so so I
00:39:35.599 would I would really look at initial
00:39:37.240 claims look to see where they come each
00:39:38.800 week as long as they're below 300K it's
00:39:40.520 not that concerning um and we'll see you
00:39:42.760 know hopefully the unemployment rate can
00:39:44.000 stay low and and not continue to go up
00:39:46.760 right now it's at 4.2% we'll see where
00:39:49.040 it comes in next month if you guys like
00:39:50.760 the content make sure you subscribe to
00:39:52.040 the channel give the video a thumbs up
00:39:54.000 and again check out uh the sale on into
00:39:56.800 the crypts premium at intothe crypto.com
00:39:59.200 you can of course get access to all
00:40:00.599 these charts we also actually have a a
00:40:02.920 macro recession risk dashboard and the
00:40:05.920 only one that's sort of screaming that
00:40:08.599 there's something coming is the interest
00:40:10.520 rate risk but it always screams at early
00:40:12.800 right if you look at if you expand this
00:40:16.000 out it always is the first to to scream
00:40:19.119 recession the interest rate risk right
00:40:22.359 and then eventually you get it right
00:40:24.280 eventually you get it when when when
00:40:25.800 this starts to fall
00:40:28.720 that's probably the time to to be
00:40:30.640 concerned and even there are times where
00:40:31.960 it
00:40:33.040 falls and it's not even the the drop
00:40:36.599 right so I would watch this one to see
00:40:39.480 like you know what it what it's going to
00:40:40.880 do here um but if you go back I mean if
00:40:43.880 you go back to the macro recession risk
00:40:45.040 dashboard you know production and
00:40:46.560 business risk still relatively low right
00:40:48.560 national income and product risk still
00:40:50.240 low employment risk still relatively low
00:40:52.960 it's a little bit more elevated than the
00:40:54.240 other ones um and if you sort of expand
00:40:56.920 it you look at it it just looks like
00:40:59.359 this where there you know there's some
00:41:00.400 scares in here but you haven't really
00:41:02.359 seen the labor market weaken to the
00:41:05.000 point of of Prior recessions just yet
00:41:07.960 and you know I'll probably do a video on
00:41:09.400 this later
00:41:10.839 on but uh the yield curve the yield
00:41:14.400 curve is in fact um uninverted
00:41:23.359 going through the
00:41:26.240 uninversity kind of like as we speak but
00:41:28.800 we'll we'll touch on that in another
00:41:30.040 video um and remember I mean even even
00:41:32.040 if it does fully un invert it can still
00:41:34.640 be some time before the markets are are
00:41:36.720 willing to pay attention and sometimes
00:41:38.079 it's taking even a year but anyways guys
00:41:39.960 we'll go and wrap it up thank you for

[PI CYCLE INDICATOR RESEARCH]


          hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be discussing the pi cycle top indicator if you guys like the content make sure you subscribe to the channel give the video a thumbs up and check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into cptv.org and the general idea is that it predicts Bitcoin top to within 3 days now you may be curious how it works essentially all it is is taking the 111 day SMA and the 350 day SMA times two and figuring out
          
          when they cross and when they cross historically that's when bitcoin's price tops out to within 3 days now you may look at this and say well that's pretty good in 2013 remember this was created in 2019 so it's easy to go back and find stuff to fit to what's more difficult is getting future Peaks which this one actually did there's a lot of indicators that fail to do that this one actually did that's why we're talking about it so in 2013 you can see that it it you know within 3 days again fit in 2019 same thing in
          
          2017 right within three days of of the Cross and in 2021 when it first got put to the test you can see that at the first top it got it to within three days now the second top obviously it did not but in the pi cycle tops defense I don't really think there were hardly any indicators that got the second top um you know to the day or anything like that and so and I also think the argument is that well if you sold at 64k in April the price of Bitcoin still went to 15K you know a year and a half later um so what if you
          
          missed it out on it going up to 69k and it only was for a few days and again it was like half a year later so in this case though what I want to draw everyone's attention to is I I could Envision a scenario in the cycle where everyone's waiting for this thing to cross and I'm not suggesting this time has to be different but I want to show you something that I have shown you before but because there's going to be some new people it's probably time to show them too so one of the things you'll notice is that every time they've
          
          crossed the time the amount of time that they stay crossed for has gotten less and less and the extent of their Crossing has diminished right look at this one keep this in mind then look in 2017 you can see that was much less significant of a cross and then look at 2021 it barely crossed I'm still sick um so then I wondered what if we were to take these two moving averages right two times the 350 SMA and 111a what if we divided them by each other if you do that you see diminishing peaks in order for them to cross this
          
          has to go above one right that's when the moving averages are equal to each other and you can see that last cycle it barely got above one the cycle before that it was all the way up here at you know 1.07 the cyc before that it was all the way up at 1.18 and 1.23 and so you can see that where people might go wrong with this in the future is assuming it gets back up to one what if it doesn't right what if it doesn't go all the way back to one because what if you're getting diminishing Peaks so if you extrapolate this which really
          
          shouldn't do and any good scientist or engineer will tell you that interpolation is okay generally speaking but extrapolation is is not a good way um to navigate things but this is dubious speculation my friends right and and of course we're going to speculate dubiously over here so if we did and we said what if we connect the Peaks where would it put it well I'm glad you asked if you ignore that one right and you just connect this one the actual top right you know the extent of the moving average
          
          division so then the next one and the next one then you get over here and you can see it would be if it were to occur now it would be around 0.9 obviously if it occurred later it might be less than point. n right now the moving average division is at 0.55 but obviously this is going to start moving up pretty aggressively soon because Bitcoin just had a fairly explosive rally right so it's going to take some time for those moving averages to catch up by definition moving average is in fact a lagging indicator and in
          
          fact in the first couple of Cycles you know you can see that by the time the moving average division peaked it was a month or two after the actual top was in it was only I mean in 2017 it occurred about a month beforehand but last cycle they basically occurred simultaneously so you can see that it's getting shifted each time to within you know to where the actual top is occurring so back in March and April we did a video on this and I suggested that you know April would be a or that March was a midcycle top and not a market
          
          cycle top and that we'd have about 6 to 9 months of a downtrend and the reason I suggested a midcycle top and not a market cycle top one of the reasons was because the p cyle indicator had only gone up to 735 or so and if you extrapolate it would have suggested that that wasn't really high enough for it to justify being a market cycle top but at some point down the line and I don't know when it's going to be and we can't even know if it's actually going to happen or not right things happen markets don't always go how we
          
          plan but at some point down the line especially within the next year or so if this moving average division of these two moving averages that make up the pcle Top If we see them getting back above 08 then you shouldn't just so caution to the wind right I mean it it would certainly warrant some level of of skepticism as to how much higher it's going to go now again extrapolation would suggest 0.9 could happen if it happens now if it happens a year from now then it could be lower than 0.9 um so it really all depends on on on when
          
          it happens and exactly how that plays out but I did think that this is a a worthwhile exercise I know the last time I did this video uh there were some mixed results or mixed comments mixed feedback I think some people liked the Insight that this gave and then other people were like well you know you're basically saying this time is different I suppose the other way to look at it is to just draw a horizontal line and to say that you know it'll hit it again but you can at least see the concern right
          
          as to what if it doesn't hit it again um what if it just sort of continues this trend and then the indicator uh doesn't actually fire in the same way that it has before to be clear though I mean I wouldn't really consider that to be a failure of the indicator I think it's actually a really interesting indicator and the interesting aspects of it can sometimes be buried right and if you actually take these things and you know you you play around with them and you and you kind of see any interesting
          
          underlying Trends you can find them and you can see that the indicator typically bottoms out moving average division around. 3 right. 3 and every time it hits around. three that's around the bottom so just something for you guys to think you know to to think about and keep in mind I'm not going to go on with this any longer for this video but you guys get the idea again this is created by Philip Swift back in 2019 I'll link his Twitter or his ex um his ex account in the uh description below if you guys
          
          want to follow him which I think you should I think he's a good voice in the space but we will go ahead and wrap it up there guys thank you for tuning in subscribe give the video a thumbs up and again check out the sale on into the Crypt premium at into the cryptoverse decom see you guys next time bye

# Bitcoin: Dubious Speculation
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/6BZw96TJhL8

00:00:00.760 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.280 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.920 to talk about Bitcoin dubious
00:00:08.119 speculation if you guys like the content
00:00:10.599 make sure you subscribe to the channel
00:00:12.120 give the video a thumbs up and check out
00:00:13.759 the sale on into the cryptoverse premium
00:00:16.920 add intothe cryptoverse decom let's go
00:00:20.439 ahead and jump in so we have quite a bit
00:00:22.800 to talk about it's been a while since we
00:00:25.000 did our last dubious speculation video
00:00:28.400 in these videos I tend to go through the
00:00:31.599 market you know as in depth as I really
00:00:34.600 can and I I like to take my time and go
00:00:36.520 through the different ways to look at
00:00:37.960 the market so that everyone knows you
00:00:40.719 know the different variables that that
00:00:42.680 could affect things here in the short
00:00:44.600 term now to get everyone up to speed
00:00:48.520 with how Bitcoin arrived at the current
00:00:52.039 level one of the things that we talked
00:00:54.480 about basically for the entire year was
00:00:57.879 that Bitcoin would likely go through a
00:01:00.600 painful bleed that would last about 6 to
00:01:04.680 n months at which point the bull market
00:01:08.520 should theoretically resume now the
00:01:11.520 reason that I said that of course was
00:01:14.640 because of usdt dominance hitting its
00:01:17.960 long-term trend line we'll talk about
00:01:19.400 that in the video too and also gold
00:01:22.000 breaking out which is what also marked
00:01:24.320 the quote unquote midcycle top in 2019
00:01:28.960 right if you overlay gold gold you'll
00:01:30.720 see a lot of the stuff is playing out in
00:01:33.159 almost the exact same way right you go
00:01:37.479 look at gold uh you identify where it
00:01:40.600 broke out in 2019 that marked a midcycle
00:01:43.360 top and from that time it took Bitcoin
00:01:47.159 about 30 weeks to break out from that
00:01:51.280 midcycle top about 30 weeks or so and we
00:01:55.840 just simply suggested hey what if this
00:01:59.320 time is not different and the Breakout
00:02:02.320 by gold marks another midcycle top for
00:02:05.439 Bitcoin at 73k not a market cycle top
00:02:09.560 but a midcycle top and what if it takes
00:02:12.400 about the same amount of time to break
00:02:13.800 out that would put it at about 30 weeks
00:02:16.120 or so and you can see it basically took
00:02:18.239 around 30 weeks from when the midcycle
00:02:20.360 top was put in so a lot of that stuff
00:02:23.000 has played out in a very similar fashion
00:02:24.760 we said 6 to 9 months 6 months would
00:02:27.680 basically get you to September which is
00:02:29.519 a what happened 9 months was in case uh
00:02:33.640 it it continued beyond that which is
00:02:35.920 always a possibility um to keep in the
00:02:38.519 back of our mind but in the short term
00:02:42.239 right at least that's how we got here
00:02:43.879 right that's how we got here and one of
00:02:46.200 the interesting things that you should
00:02:48.440 be aware of is that
00:02:51.120 Bitcoin has really been very responsive
00:02:55.200 to the labor market this year and if
00:02:58.400 you're wondering why bit coin has kind
00:03:00.959 of hesitated here for the last couple of
00:03:03.720 weeks it's been doing the same thing
00:03:06.640 essentially all year long and what I'm
00:03:09.080 talking about is it gets a move up right
00:03:13.239 it'll it'll find some type of a move
00:03:16.000 up sort of early part of the month to
00:03:18.920 the mid part of the month and then it
00:03:21.080 will stall out until the labor market
00:03:24.920 data is released okay now if you look at
00:03:29.799 a lot of these prior moves by Bitcoin
00:03:32.799 that marked local tops in 2024 you'll
00:03:36.239 find April
00:03:38.040 2024 you'll find June and then you'll
00:03:41.840 find Late July early August but what
00:03:44.400 you'll notice is that every single time
00:03:47.319 that Bitcoin put in a lower high it was
00:03:50.799 just after or just around the time of
00:03:55.040 the labor market release that occurs at
00:03:57.480 the beginning of the month we also saw
00:04:00.159 something similar over here going into
00:04:02.680 late October or mid October Bitcoin had
00:04:05.120 a push higher and then it paused for a
00:04:07.599 couple of weeks we said that was the
00:04:09.360 most likely outcome and that it would
00:04:10.879 likely wait until early November to make
00:04:14.000 a decision we put out a video called
00:04:16.680 Bitcoin decision time and what I said in
00:04:20.560 that video was that if the labor market
00:04:23.840 data comes in okay then it's likely that
00:04:27.440 Bitcoin continues its w and follows the
00:04:31.639 cyclical View and we'll talk more about
00:04:33.720 that now what actually happened in
00:04:37.720 November if you overlay the unemployment
00:04:41.000 rate what you'll notice is that all of
00:04:44.280 these lower highs by Bitcoin were
00:04:47.680 occurring right they were all occurring
00:04:50.320 while the unemployment rate was starting
00:04:52.360 to accelerate to the upside right if you
00:04:55.080 look at the unemployment rate the lower
00:04:58.080 highs came in
00:05:00.400 once the unemployment rate really
00:05:02.919 started to move up quickly okay this
00:05:06.720 slower move by the unemployment rate
00:05:09.160 Bitcoin didn't really care as much about
00:05:12.160 it was when it started to accelerate .1%
00:05:15.800 essentially every month that Bitcoin
00:05:18.560 started to pay
00:05:20.240 attention but what I said a month ago
00:05:24.520 and you can go back and watch the video
00:05:26.120 it was called decision time I believe
00:05:28.039 what I said if the unemployment rate
00:05:31.160 comes in at either 4% or
00:05:35.720 4.1% meaning it's as long as it's not
00:05:38.440 going up then Bitcoin should
00:05:41.639 follow its cyclical view now the
00:05:45.120 cyclical view of Bitcoin is essentially
00:05:48.479 twofold it's first of all the year-to
00:05:51.000 DAT Roi of Bitcoin in having years right
00:05:55.479 you compare 2024 to
00:05:58.039 2016 2012 12 and 2020 normally Bitcoin
00:06:03.120 goes up in Q4 of having years right so
00:06:08.240 if Bitcoin was going to follow the
00:06:11.080 cyclical view then it would mean going
00:06:13.720 up in Q4 of the having year and if you
00:06:16.840 average out all prior having years you
00:06:19.800 can see that they really start to pick
00:06:21.919 up in Q4 if you overlay 2024 with it you
00:06:25.720 can see that it's essentially the
00:06:27.000 year-to date Roi of Bitcoin in 2024
00:06:29.599 nearly matches the average of all prior
00:06:31.639 having years what's more interesting
00:06:34.280 though is that this 2024 year-to dat Roi
00:06:39.039 clo most closely matches 2023 just a
00:06:42.440 slightly diminished version of it uh you
00:06:45.360 can see that for most of the year the
00:06:47.319 return on investment of Bitcoin in 2024
00:06:50.680 has been slightly lower than what
00:06:53.000 Bitcoin experienced in 2023 except for
00:06:56.680 very early on it it briefly went above
00:06:59.000 it uh but for the most part it's just
00:07:00.800 been slightly below where it was in
00:07:04.360 2023 now if Bitcoin is to continue to
00:07:09.120 follow the cyclical view then it could
00:07:12.560 get one more push higher before the end
00:07:15.360 of the
00:07:16.360 year if you look at it compared to 2020
00:07:20.039 though you'll see also it would favor
00:07:22.000 another push higher just like 2012 the
00:07:24.759 Counterpoint is that a lot of people
00:07:26.840 have made comparisons to 2016 in 2024 in
00:07:30.919 fact there are a lot of similarities you
00:07:32.960 have the same president elect right
00:07:36.000 Trump is going to be taking office you
00:07:38.160 have a rally by the dollar you have a
00:07:40.120 rally by the long of the O curve all
00:07:42.000 happening in Q4 this all happened in Q4
00:07:44.400 2016 as well and at the same time
00:07:48.280 bitcoin's been following typically what
00:07:49.919 it had did in 2016 I guess the one thing
00:07:52.919 to note is that the ROI of Bitcoin in
00:07:55.520 2024 already matched what it hit in 2016
00:07:59.759 so that might be sort of a slightly
00:08:01.520 negative point to at least keep in mind
00:08:03.879 showing you that there's obviously no
00:08:06.000 guarantees and in early
00:08:08.639 2017 Bitcoin actually had a little
00:08:11.440 pushup and then it had a correction
00:08:13.319 we'll talk a little about that in in a
00:08:14.599 little bit as
00:08:15.720 well so that is essentially the cyclical
00:08:19.240 view from a having year perspective if
00:08:22.240 you look at it as measured from the
00:08:24.240 bottom what you'll notice is that
00:08:26.800 Bitcoin kind of got ahead of schedule
00:08:29.120 compared to the last cycle and it needed
00:08:31.879 to get back in line with the prior
00:08:34.200 cycles and the reason we said that was
00:08:36.240 because the cycle before essentially did
00:08:38.080 the same thing right where it eventually
00:08:40.839 it got ahead of schedule we then the
00:08:43.440 year that we saw rate Cuts 2019 Bitcoin
00:08:45.959 faded back in line with the prior cycles
00:08:48.720 and then started to go back up and then
00:08:50.560 of course we got a landing now if you
00:08:53.640 look at that was a recession right that
00:08:55.680 was a pandemic induced recession if you
00:08:59.839 look this cycle it's been a little bit
00:09:01.839 different the sort of the surge occurred
00:09:05.079 a little bit later on because also rate
00:09:07.279 Cuts occurred a little bit later on and
00:09:09.360 you can also see that it's now gotten
00:09:11.360 back in line with prior cycles and it's
00:09:13.200 starting to track those Cycles now you
00:09:15.120 could always get a landing right I mean
00:09:17.360 at any time something like that could
00:09:19.440 happen that it sort of just comes out of
00:09:21.240 left field no one's really expecting it
00:09:24.120 and and it surprises people that's what
00:09:27.079 happened last cycle but you don't have
00:09:28.959 to get that right and I mean it's not
00:09:30.640 necessarily an investing strategy
00:09:32.240 waiting for something like that that's
00:09:34.000 why I said just stay Bitcoin heavy until
00:09:36.079 Bitcoin dominance hit 60% and then start
00:09:38.600 to diversify some into the altcoins
00:09:41.200 because they probably will start to
00:09:42.839 catch up a little bit and as you can see
00:09:44.360 Bitcoin dominance has fallen quite a bit
00:09:46.680 over the last few weeks so that is the
00:09:50.360 cyclical view right that's the cyclical
00:09:52.480 View and and and bitcoin's really
00:09:54.560 continuing to follow that cyclical view
00:09:57.880 so in order for Bitcoin to continue to
00:10:01.680 push higher though into the end of the
00:10:04.880 year and continue to follow the cyclical
00:10:07.600 view then arguably the labor market data
00:10:11.320 needs to come in relatively okay this
00:10:14.040 month okay so I would say if the
00:10:17.399 unemployment rate were to come in at 4%
00:10:20.800 or 4.1 then it would likely favor
00:10:24.480 Bitcoin to continue to go up into the
00:10:27.800 end of the year one of the things I've
00:10:30.440 also mentioned before is that in 2016
00:10:33.760 the dollar rallied into the end of the
00:10:37.360 year if you go look at the
00:10:40.360 dollar we've been bullish over here on
00:10:42.560 the dollar uh for basically all of Q4
00:10:45.920 and I said when the FED cut rates in
00:10:48.320 September that the dollar would likely
00:10:50.000 rally into the end of the year and you
00:10:51.680 can see essentially this is where the
00:10:52.839 FED Cut Rate September 18th right over
00:10:54.800 here the dollar has been rallying and I
00:10:57.720 think it's going to get one final push
00:11:00.680 into the end of the year it's not I mean
00:11:03.200 look guys it's not rocket science right
00:11:05.160 I mean I I could be wrong um but it it
00:11:08.760 it is it's basically what we saw happen
00:11:12.079 in 2016 right where the
00:11:14.519 dollar put in these higher lows and it
00:11:18.240 it then put in another low in early
00:11:20.800 December and then rallied on up into
00:11:23.639 early
00:11:25.079 January now the long end of the yield
00:11:28.040 curve long in the yield
00:11:31.160 curve 10year yield also rallied back
00:11:34.800 then as well right if you look at at
00:11:36.920 2016 you'll see that the dollar the long
00:11:39.120 of theal curve also rallied so if if the
00:11:42.120 dollar is to Rally into the end of the
00:11:44.760 year it would imply that the long end
00:11:47.560 rallies into the end of the year the do
00:11:50.720 the long end has actually been getting a
00:11:52.040 pullback recently but I wonder if it's
00:11:53.880 just repeating what it did over here
00:11:56.360 where you know it it basically got sort
00:11:59.399 of a a early
00:12:01.240 breakout right and then followed by sort
00:12:03.399 of a pullback below the trend line and
00:12:06.720 then it then moved up again so I wonder
00:12:08.880 if we're going to see the the 10-year
00:12:10.360 yield turn around here so the way I see
00:12:13.199 it is this um the unemployment rate
00:12:16.680 comes in at 4% or 4.1 then it would
00:12:21.279 favor the cyclical view to continue to
00:12:25.360 Prevail right um it would favor it to
00:12:28.279 continue to prevail
00:12:29.720 and to take precedence and and to not
00:12:32.519 fade the cyclical view as I've said
00:12:35.880 Bitcoin needs a reason to go down not a
00:12:39.639 reason to go up Bitcoin just naturally
00:12:42.839 goes up because people DCA Bitcoin right
00:12:46.519 so it tends to go up for no reason at
00:12:50.639 all if it's going to go down it needs a
00:12:52.720 reason and you know essentially from
00:12:55.880 March until August the unemployment rate
00:12:59.959 gave Bitcoin a reason to go down right
00:13:02.680 because the unemployment rate was
00:13:04.040 accelerating
00:13:05.320 higher but ever since August the
00:13:09.880 unemployment rate was dropping or going
00:13:12.880 sideways and you can see that's where
00:13:14.600 the low occurred for Bitcoin it was in
00:13:18.920 August of 2024 that low occurred and it
00:13:22.079 happened to correspond to when the
00:13:24.160 unemployment rate stopped going up and
00:13:26.519 then we got a lower print so
00:13:29.639 if you're looking for a reason for
00:13:31.360 Bitcoin to drop you essentially would
00:13:33.519 need to see the unemployment rate start
00:13:35.600 to go back up so I think I I think if
00:13:39.440 it's between
00:13:41.399 4% to
00:13:43.760 4.1% then it would likely be a good
00:13:46.519 thing for Bitcoin because if the coast
00:13:48.839 is clear in terms of the labor market
00:13:52.240 then Bitcoin will likely use that
00:13:53.600 opportunity to go higher now you might
00:13:54.920 think well if the if if the labor market
00:13:56.839 data comes in strong and the dollar
00:13:59.399 rallies and the long end rallies
00:14:00.839 wouldn't that be negative for Bitcoin
00:14:03.079 and and theoretically you could have
00:14:04.839 sort of an event like August where you
00:14:07.519 get a a a quick selloff if the long end
00:14:10.399 rallies but the Counterpoint is that in
00:14:12.920 2016 Q4 the dollar rally the long and
00:14:15.360 rallied and Bitcoin rallied it was
00:14:17.160 altcoins that that that got left behind
00:14:19.320 in December of 2016 not Bitcoin so if if
00:14:22.720 it's 4% to
00:14:24.720 4.1% then that would probably be a good
00:14:27.240 thing okay if it's
00:14:31.399 4.2% I would argue that it's probably
00:14:34.279 more so neutral right it's not good but
00:14:38.560 it's also not like the worst thing in
00:14:40.440 the world either right I mean it could
00:14:41.839 just be some level of normalization now
00:14:44.360 if it comes in at
00:14:45.720 42 you could still see Bitcoin go up but
00:14:49.279 then I almost wonder if it would make
00:14:51.279 sense to defer to sort of that 2016 view
00:14:55.320 where it already kind of hit that
00:14:57.560 year-to-date Roi
00:14:59.519 and it's just going to cool off for the
00:15:01.160 rest of the year right if it comes in at
00:15:02.639 4.2 there's a chance that happens um but
00:15:06.680 4.2 is really not good or bad it's just
00:15:09.199 kind of you know somewhere in between it
00:15:12.120 it wouldn't be enough evidence to
00:15:14.720 suggest that it's truly starting to
00:15:17.360 accelerate again but it's also would
00:15:20.279 sort of leave a question mark as to
00:15:22.160 whether the uptrend by the unemployment
00:15:23.920 rate is actually over um obviously at
00:15:27.959 this point there's not nearly as much
00:15:30.079 wiggle room in the labor market as there
00:15:32.720 were as there was a couple years ago you
00:15:35.000 know if you were to go look at at say
00:15:37.040 job openings um and a number of other
00:15:39.680 things right job openings they've
00:15:41.800 dropped a lot right they're basically
00:15:43.279 back to the pre-pandemic highs and we're
00:15:45.440 about to get this data you know tomorrow
00:15:47.560 I believe um there's just not that that
00:15:50.120 a lot of the excess that was there is no
00:15:53.079 longer there right job quits is has
00:15:57.759 dropped Like a Rock right people aren't
00:15:59.279 leaving their jobs if you look at hires
00:16:03.000 if you look at hires people also aren't
00:16:05.279 really getting hired either right hires
00:16:07.720 are down job openings are down job quits
00:16:10.399 are down um so the labor market has
00:16:13.759 really loosened up recently but you know
00:16:17.079 it's also down initial claims so what
00:16:20.199 that suggests is that layoffs really
00:16:23.000 aren't that high despite what you might
00:16:25.680 read in the headlines right they're
00:16:26.880 they're really not that high but if you
00:16:29.160 look at continued
00:16:31.920 claims you can tell that once people do
00:16:34.560 get laid off they're having a harder
00:16:36.199 time finding a new job because highers
00:16:37.880 are down people aren't really quitting
00:16:39.639 their job so there's fewer job openings
00:16:42.079 and then continue claims you can see
00:16:43.399 have been trading higher meaning that
00:16:44.959 people are having a harder time finding
00:16:46.399 a new job whenever they do get laid off
00:16:49.639 so I would say you know 4 to 41 good
00:16:55.680 4.2 it's kind of neutral right I mean
00:16:58.120 maybe Bitcoin would just wait until CPI
00:17:00.079 data um in you know in in a in a week or
00:17:03.880 two before
00:17:05.559 deciding if it's any higher right than
00:17:09.599 this right if it if it comes in at 4.3
00:17:14.640 plus I I think that would be sort of
00:17:18.919 construed as bad right I think that
00:17:21.319 would be construed as bad if it if it
00:17:22.640 were to come in at 4.3% because then it
00:17:26.039 would suggest that this move here
00:17:29.640 was just very shortlived and that it's
00:17:31.600 just going to Simply continue higher so
00:17:34.160 that's how I think it makes sense to
00:17:36.440 view sort of Bitcoin short-term price
00:17:39.120 action now the reason why this stuff is
00:17:41.280 important and the reason why we talk
00:17:43.320 about this stuff is because you know
00:17:45.799 when Bitcoin stalls out like it has been
00:17:48.919 for the last couple of weeks that's
00:17:51.000 usually when the altcoin market takes
00:17:53.600 advantage and the reason for that is
00:17:55.880 because when Bitcoin moves quickly the
00:17:59.240 altcoin market stands still right the
00:18:02.320 altcoin market bows to the king the
00:18:05.720 altcoin market typically would not dare
00:18:08.360 move when the king is moving and so if
00:18:11.240 Bitcoin is stalling out that's normally
00:18:14.000 when the altcoin market start to make
00:18:15.880 its move and that's why when Bitcoin
00:18:17.840 dominance hit 60% which was my target
00:18:20.360 for the last three years I said it was
00:18:22.400 time to diversify into other coins
00:18:25.840 because a lot of them probably have some
00:18:27.919 catching up to do
00:18:29.919 um now that doesn't mean they can't get
00:18:32.320 hit if Bitcoin goes down it just it's
00:18:34.720 important to understand what's going to
00:18:36.919 move the needle for Bitcoin what's going
00:18:38.880 to move the needle for Bitcoin is the
00:18:40.960 labor market right so if the
00:18:42.720 unemployment rate comes in low then what
00:18:45.679 you're likely going to see happen you
00:18:47.840 know maybe about mid December or so is
00:18:50.640 Bitcoin start to move up once again if
00:18:53.440 it comes in high the unemployment rate
00:18:56.200 comes in high then maybe you up getting
00:18:59.280 the landing after all and then people
00:19:01.240 start to then get fearful that there's
00:19:03.799 still a lot more to go with the
00:19:05.760 unemployment rate before it's truly
00:19:07.360 topped out so that's where I I I
00:19:10.440 currently think um you know that's kind
00:19:14.600 of what I think about the market at the
00:19:17.280 current time as it relates to to Bitcoin
00:19:21.559 now there's other things that we can
00:19:23.840 talk about obviously um you know it's
00:19:26.840 not just the unemployment rate it's it's
00:19:28.840 not just you know what's Bitcoin doing
00:19:32.240 here there's other comparisons we can
00:19:33.799 make as well and some of those
00:19:35.039 comparisons I've talked to you guys
00:19:36.320 before about and and one of them is the
00:19:39.880 comparison between Bitcoin and the QQQ
00:19:42.720 launch from 202 years ago right or um
00:19:47.520 you know I guess it was more than 22
00:19:48.919 years ago it was like 25 years ago if
00:19:51.120 you guys remember the QQQ was launched
00:19:54.640 um in 1999 I'm sure everyone of us
00:19:57.159 remembers that I was 9 years old
00:19:59.320 uh of course I was glued to the charts
00:20:01.720 obviously I was not um but if you look
00:20:04.360 at the QQQ launch you know I I've been
00:20:06.720 following it this year and it's actually
00:20:08.080 been really helpful in in you know sort
00:20:10.720 of Paving out a path for Bitcoin you
00:20:13.400 know it launched at 48 uh or so and and
00:20:16.880 and Bitcoin launched at 40 the ETF for
00:20:18.840 Bitcoin launched when it was 48k and
00:20:20.880 essentially you can see that the QQQ
00:20:23.640 also had sort of a low in August now it
00:20:25.799 was a higher low compared to may but it
00:20:28.080 was still a drop in August and then
00:20:30.520 another drop sort of in mid October so
00:20:33.960 August and then mid October you go look
00:20:37.039 at Bitcoin and you'll find something
00:20:38.960 very very similar right it launched when
00:20:42.000 it when the ETF launched when Bitcoin
00:20:44.000 you know it tagged 48k it had a a drop
00:20:47.080 in August and then it had another drop
00:20:49.520 here in mid October so it it seems
00:20:52.760 somewhat familiar now what ended up
00:20:55.559 happening with the QQQ back then it also
00:20:58.600 o had trouble breaking through the 100
00:21:00.760 Milestone so for for the QQQ it was 100
00:21:03.720 for Bitcoin it's 100K but it's all I
00:21:05.679 mean it's just you know it's just to um
00:21:07.720 add some zeros onto the number but
00:21:09.440 you'll see here that the QQQ you know it
00:21:12.799 took it about a month or so to really
00:21:15.919 break through it went up to 96 and then
00:21:18.120 had a drop to 79 or so or back to 80 and
00:21:21.159 then it went up to 97 or almost 98 and
00:21:24.000 then it dropped back to
00:21:25.440 83 so it did take it some time to get
00:21:29.240 there what's really interesting though
00:21:31.559 is that it did eventually break through
00:21:33.840 and It ultimately went to
00:21:36.799 120 the reason why
00:21:39.480 120 is interesting is because if you go
00:21:43.520 back to bitcoin's year-to-date
00:21:46.600 rli and you compare this having year
00:21:50.640 with the average of Prior having years
00:21:54.120 what you'll notice right what you'll
00:21:57.000 notice is that would put the year to dat
00:21:59.720 if it if it is able to track the average
00:22:01.600 of Prior Happ years into the end of the
00:22:03.480 year it would put it at 3x from the
00:22:05.760 yearly open now the yearly open was
00:22:07.760 around 40K right so 3x from the yearly
00:22:11.279 open is
00:22:13.240 120k which is exactly where the QQQ
00:22:17.120 went one year after it launched right it
00:22:21.240 launched in 19 in March 99 and then it
00:22:23.960 rallied up to at 48 or so and then it
00:22:26.279 rallied up to
00:22:27.520 120 about a year later in fact it almost
00:22:30.440 lines up perfectly and sometimes it
00:22:32.159 makes me feel like we're living in a
00:22:33.640 simulation because if you look at this
00:22:35.960 it topped 54 weeks later I'm not
00:22:40.039 suggesting that Bitcoin has to find a
00:22:41.679 market cycle top 54 weeks after the ETF
00:22:44.039 launch but you could get a correction at
00:22:46.720 that point um and and one of the reasons
00:22:49.000 for that perhaps it's the people that
00:22:51.520 bought the ETF when it first launch they
00:22:53.320 find themselves up 3x they decide
00:22:55.000 they're in long-term capital gains
00:22:56.240 territory why not take some profits
00:22:58.240 right so that's 54 weeks later what's
00:23:01.559 really fascinating about that is if you
00:23:03.840 look at something very similar for
00:23:05.520 Bitcoin what you'll notice is that 54
00:23:09.679 weeks after the ETF
00:23:12.520 launch happens to
00:23:15.279 be the week of January 20th why is that
00:23:18.360 interesting well the week of January
00:23:20.320 20th is inauguration the week of January
00:23:23.840 20th is when Gary guinsler is resigning
00:23:28.039 you have to wonder you know does every
00:23:31.000 good thing possible get priced in before
00:23:34.720 the inauguration and then once the
00:23:36.279 inauguration actually happens people are
00:23:38.120 like all right now that the Strategic
00:23:40.240 Reserve has been priced in do we
00:23:42.320 actually get it and you know it could be
00:23:44.600 sort of the uh maybe you know some
00:23:47.640 trepidation as to whether it happens or
00:23:49.559 not that causes a potential correction
00:23:51.480 in January what's really interesting is
00:23:54.279 you know Corrections know while it would
00:23:56.520 correspond to a correction one year
00:23:59.000 after the ETF launch um another thing to
00:24:02.960 note with Bitcoin is that it actually
00:24:04.640 does typically get a correction in
00:24:06.559 January of post having years right if
00:24:08.880 you go look at January of 2021 you can
00:24:12.080 see that there was a correction by
00:24:13.480 Bitcoin if you look at January of 2017
00:24:17.039 there was a correction by Bitcoin now if
00:24:19.840 you measure out those Corrections they
00:24:21.679 were you know somewhat substantial not
00:24:23.799 like that bad but 35% there and then in
00:24:27.520 2021 about a 32% correction now you
00:24:31.440 could argue that we're here right you
00:24:35.080 could argue that we're here in fact the
00:24:36.880 week of November 23rd last cycle in 2020
00:24:42.240 also had sort of a small red candle a
00:24:45.279 small candle body with a long Wick down
00:24:48.520 and if you look here you can see almost
00:24:49.919 something very similar a small candle
00:24:51.399 body with a long Wick down I guess the
00:24:53.520 main difference though is the following
00:24:55.080 week Bitcoin basically just went up
00:24:57.279 whereas this week we can already see
00:24:58.880 that there actually has been a bit of a
00:25:00.279 correction so it's not necessarily the
00:25:02.520 same thing but it is interesting to sort
00:25:05.120 of line those things up and to figure
00:25:07.159 out you know to to to see that
00:25:09.320 seasonality on the chart right you go
00:25:11.200 measure that the year Roi you can see
00:25:13.840 that seasonality on on the chart and and
00:25:16.840 argue that you know that's essentially
00:25:18.919 what happened right in in November of
00:25:21.399 2020 is that Bitcoin hesitated for a few
00:25:24.120 weeks which is exactly what is happening
00:25:27.080 right now right it's hesitating and
00:25:28.919 arguably the reason it is hesitating
00:25:30.919 right now is because it's just simply
00:25:32.559 waiting for the labor market data to
00:25:33.919 come in if you go look at the macro
00:25:36.320 dashboard over on into the cryptoverse
00:25:38.000 premium and you just look at all the
00:25:40.039 things coming up this week you have so
00:25:42.120 much labor market data coming in right
00:25:43.640 you got the employment level job
00:25:45.000 openings job quits uh hires layoffs and
00:25:47.919 discharges all coming in on Tuesday on
00:25:51.039 Wednesday you got manufactur new orders
00:25:53.720 you got non-farm private payroll
00:25:55.320 employment on Thursday you got initial
00:25:58.320 claims and continue claims and then on
00:25:59.919 Friday you have average hourly earnings
00:26:01.960 average hours work per week um on the
00:26:05.240 unemployment level as well as as initial
00:26:09.000 claims per state um continued claims per
00:26:12.320 state the civilian Labor Force Level etc
00:26:14.919 etc etc right so you have a lot of Labor
00:26:17.320 Market data coming in this week which is
00:26:19.240 what Bitcoin tends to look at right
00:26:21.600 where you know it tends to look at that
00:26:22.919 labor market data if it comes in okay
00:26:25.760 then Bitcoin tends to go up if it comes
00:26:27.840 in bad then Bitcoin tends to go
00:26:30.520 down that's the way it historically has
00:26:32.720 worked so what I would say again if the
00:26:35.279 labor market data comes in okay then it
00:26:37.000 would favor Bitcoin to Rally into the
00:26:39.960 end of the year and if it does rally
00:26:42.039 into the year you might actually see
00:26:43.320 Bitcoin dominance go back up that
00:26:44.840 doesn't mean it's going to put in a
00:26:45.919 higher high it could be a lower high but
00:26:48.039 if Bitcoin if the unemployment rate does
00:26:49.799 come in really low and everything comes
00:26:52.080 in low it likely means the long end
00:26:53.840 rallies it means the dollar rallies and
00:26:55.399 if those two rally and we're still risk
00:26:57.399 on then it would likely mean that
00:26:59.080 Bitcoin would would sort of catch a
00:27:00.480 Tailwind from that and Bitcoin dominance
00:27:02.120 could in fact bounce um that's
00:27:04.880 essentially what happened in in 2020 but
00:27:07.480 if on the other hand the labor market
00:27:09.520 data comes in very weak then it would
00:27:12.320 call into question those views on the
00:27:13.919 dollar call into question the views on
00:27:15.360 the long of the deal curve and thus it
00:27:16.600 could call into question you know the
00:27:18.840 the cyclical view of Bitcoin the main
00:27:21.679 things you know I always want to look at
00:27:23.520 at at what are sort of the uh the
00:27:25.799 reasons to be cautious not not as a Reon
00:27:28.360 to not be invested per se as I've said
00:27:30.399 I've just been you know for the longest
00:27:31.960 time I was just Bitcoin only I've only
00:27:34.080 recently Diversified over the last
00:27:35.559 couple of months or so as Bitcoin
00:27:37.000 dominance at 60% I wanted to make sure I
00:27:39.600 sort of captured some of the gains
00:27:41.440 elsewhere in the market from some
00:27:43.279 lagging coins that hadn't really moved
00:27:46.360 um as a lesson you don't have to sit in
00:27:48.880 altcoins for three years during a
00:27:50.360 Bitcoin Dominus rally right you can just
00:27:52.760 stick with Bitcoin until Bitcoin
00:27:54.200 dominance shows signs of topping and
00:27:56.679 then diversify and that way preserve the
00:27:58.679 satosi valuation of your portfolio but
00:28:01.880 it's always a good idea to sort of look
00:28:03.480 around and see you know what what could
00:28:05.559 we be missing like is there any chance
00:28:07.679 that you get a correction before January
00:28:10.760 is there any chance that something like
00:28:11.880 that happens and like anything's
00:28:13.679 possible anything's always possible um
00:28:16.399 you know yes it's possible that you get
00:28:18.880 a landing we did get a landing last
00:28:20.880 cycle the main things that I'm looking
00:28:23.559 at that give me a little bit of pause
00:28:26.240 but as long as the market doesn't go up
00:28:27.600 too quickly that it's not that big of a
00:28:29.120 deal is if you actually look at the
00:28:32.440 extension well if you look at the bull
00:28:33.880 market support band you can see that
00:28:36.320 Bitcoin is fairly extended from it right
00:28:38.640 but if you actually take the natural log
00:28:40.919 of the price over the 20we moving
00:28:42.440 average it has gotten somewhat extended
00:28:45.679 here okay and and the only reason I
00:28:48.039 point this out is if you look at this
00:28:50.080 chart and you look at sort of these
00:28:51.519 lower highs by the extension from the TW
00:28:55.200 the price of Bitcoin from the 20we
00:28:56.640 moving average you can see that whenever
00:28:59.519 it hits this trend line it tends to
00:29:02.120 correspond to a correction in fact the
00:29:04.720 last time we hit this trend line was
00:29:06.080 back in March and Bitcoin got a
00:29:08.279 correction back when no one thought it
00:29:10.240 could get a correction it then got a
00:29:11.720 correction now 2021 would show you late
00:29:15.760 2020 early 2021 would show you that just
00:29:18.039 because you hit the trend line doesn't
00:29:19.279 mean Bitcoin can't go up right you could
00:29:21.000 hit the trend line get a little bit of a
00:29:23.000 pullback kind of like we're in right now
00:29:24.919 and then go up again and go to a higher
00:29:26.519 price because the extension from the
00:29:28.559 20we SMA remember you're measuring the
00:29:30.159 extension from something that is
00:29:31.679 changing so as long as the 20we SMA
00:29:34.640 continues to go up then the price would
00:29:37.559 have to stay
00:29:39.559 constant or even if the price stayed
00:29:41.799 constant while the 20we moving average
00:29:43.320 went up then the extension from the 20we
00:29:44.640 moving average would actually drop okay
00:29:47.240 so you have to be careful by taking too
00:29:50.120 many assumptions from tagging the trend
00:29:51.640 line because sometimes you can tag it
00:29:53.799 and and get a correction off of it and
00:29:55.559 then go up again a few weeks later only
00:29:58.559 to then go down right so you do need to
00:30:01.080 be aware of that that is something that
00:30:03.600 I I I've you know I have thought about
00:30:05.760 and I I think what it makes the most
00:30:08.039 sense to do is is just see where the
00:30:09.640 labor market data comes in I mean if it
00:30:11.320 comes in super low like if the
00:30:14.080 unemployment rate is low that's probably
00:30:15.640 a good thing if it's bad if it comes in
00:30:17.640 high it's probably a bad thing and you
00:30:18.919 might actually get a larger correction
00:30:20.200 by Bitcoin before January it's just that
00:30:22.519 normally you do get a correction in
00:30:24.600 January although you could argue that
00:30:26.840 there's a lot of things in seasonality
00:30:28.559 that haven't necessarily played out I
00:30:29.960 would say it maybe plays out about 70%
00:30:31.840 of the
00:30:32.760 time the other thing that is still
00:30:34.880 somewhat similar to March although I do
00:30:36.919 put less and less weight on it is usdt
00:30:39.159 dominance I'll tell you why I I've put
00:30:42.399 um you know or I haven't been focusing
00:30:44.640 on as much as I was back in March so
00:30:46.440 back in March I was noting that usdt
00:30:49.679 dominance was hitting this long-term
00:30:51.279 trend line and therefore it made sense
00:30:53.519 to be cautious and we would likely get a
00:30:56.240 correction and you can see that we did
00:30:58.200 now it's possible that we get a
00:31:00.399 correction again but what you'll notice
00:31:03.320 is that we've arguably broken beneath
00:31:06.120 this trend line which is something I
00:31:08.000 said that would eventually happen right
00:31:10.080 it it has to happen eventually the
00:31:12.000 reason it has to happen is because if
00:31:14.960 you extend this trend line to you know
00:31:17.679 for eternity then eventually the the it
00:31:19.840 would imply the USD dominance if it
00:31:21.600 never breaks down eventually goes above
00:31:23.679 100% which doesn't make sense so at some
00:31:25.720 point the USD dominance trend line has
00:31:28.279 to break okay right it has to and and
00:31:32.440 you can see that it has I guess you
00:31:34.200 could redraw the trend line to connect
00:31:36.320 these Wicks down here but I mean even
00:31:39.519 then I I I don't think you're drawing it
00:31:41.399 in a way that doesn't look like it's
00:31:44.000 broken down I think you know it's sort
00:31:45.840 of you draw the trend line like this and
00:31:48.960 then you see that it's broken down so
00:31:50.919 what I think you do at this point and I
00:31:53.519 said this is likely going to happen is
00:31:55.639 that you then start looking for
00:31:57.159 horizontal support levels right rather
00:31:59.480 than this the the the trend line you
00:32:02.039 start looking at horizontal support
00:32:03.600 levels and on the weekly you got one
00:32:05.200 right here where the where the usdc
00:32:07.240 dominance currently is you also have one
00:32:09.159 a little bit down at 3.8% but the reason
00:32:12.519 why this thing is becoming you know I
00:32:15.200 mean I'm not saying it has no relevance
00:32:17.120 it it certainly does but the reason why
00:32:20.279 I haven't been um you know as loud about
00:32:24.440 it in in you know November as I was back
00:32:27.639 in in
00:32:28.960 March was because is because the USD
00:32:31.720 market cap is is absolutely going
00:32:33.679 parabolic right now right I mean if you
00:32:35.039 look at at USD market
00:32:38.360 cap it's basically just going straight
00:32:40.720 up
00:32:42.440 right you see that right how it's just
00:32:44.600 going vertical almost a lot quicker than
00:32:48.440 it was back over here in March so let me
00:32:52.679 let me pull it up on a
00:32:54.960 um let me just pull it up right here
00:32:59.320 so if you look at it I mean it's been
00:33:00.919 you know just at the beginning of
00:33:02.679 November it was at 120 billion now it's
00:33:04.600 at 134 billion so what does that mean
00:33:07.039 right what does that mean well
00:33:08.440 essentially what's happening is that
00:33:10.360 usdt dominance isn't really going that
00:33:13.559 much lower over the last few weeks so
00:33:15.960 why is it not going lower even though
00:33:18.200 total market cap is exploding the reason
00:33:20.919 it's not going much lower it's it's been
00:33:22.559 slowing down is because the usct printer
00:33:26.000 is on right I mean every seems like
00:33:27.519 every single day almost not every day
00:33:29.360 but every few days there's another
00:33:31.039 billion minted okay so if you're going
00:33:34.080 to keep minting a few billion here and
00:33:36.519 there right what's a few billion among
00:33:37.760 friends then it's going to make it hard
00:33:39.639 for usdt dominance to go to go too much
00:33:42.200 further down because if you just keep
00:33:44.200 minting more of it right another billion
00:33:46.480 here another billion there the market
00:33:48.159 cap of usdt of goes up and if the market
00:33:50.600 cap goes up then the dominance goes up
00:33:53.399 so the only way the dominance goes down
00:33:55.919 is if the market cap the entire asset
00:33:57.799 class without usct is going up quicker
00:34:01.279 than USD itself and while that has been
00:34:04.120 the case for the last few weeks you can
00:34:06.320 see that the pace at which it's
00:34:07.600 outpacing USD growth has been slowing
00:34:11.440 down okay so I just want to point this
00:34:15.520 out because if there is a correction
00:34:19.040 whether it be say in December from the
00:34:21.480 current levels or whether it's say in
00:34:24.839 January potentially you know a year at
00:34:27.760 after the ETF launch and maybe at a
00:34:30.159 higher you know it could be at a higher
00:34:31.359 valuation right it could be Bitcoin
00:34:33.119 could be above 100K then you know you
00:34:35.760 could get a very strong move by usct
00:34:38.639 dominance back up to the upside okay so
00:34:42.399 I would keep an eye on this it's been
00:34:44.440 hanging out around Point around 4% just
00:34:47.239 a little less than 4% um if it does
00:34:50.960 break down again below say 3.8 then I
00:34:55.760 guess you go look at the November 20 21
00:34:58.240 High and that's a lot lower right that's
00:35:00.960 a lot
00:35:02.680 lower and so I don't really know the
00:35:05.119 best way to uh to sort of look at at at
00:35:07.480 this trend um and I don't know exactly
00:35:10.119 how much lower it could go but it is
00:35:12.040 something to at least keep in mind all
00:35:15.040 right if there is a correction by
00:35:16.880 Bitcoin obviously it would it would
00:35:18.680 bring the altcoin market it would sort
00:35:20.480 of rain in the altcoins all right I
00:35:23.320 would speculate that if there is a
00:35:25.520 correction by Bitcoin we might actually
00:35:27.880 see Bitcoin dominance go back up not
00:35:30.160 necessarily to a higher high but we
00:35:32.480 probably would see it go back up because
00:35:34.599 QE still hasn't started yet right and so
00:35:37.640 I I I wouldn't be that surprised if if
00:35:39.480 dominance went back up if Bitcoin did
00:35:42.000 get a correction or if Bitcoin got a
00:35:43.800 rally above 100K then you would likely
00:35:45.800 see dominance go back up in fact if you
00:35:48.520 look at at Bitcoin USD and you overlay
00:35:51.920 Bitcoin dominance onto the chart one of
00:35:53.960 the things you'll notice is that last
00:35:57.359 year
00:35:58.599 um around the time that Bitcoin broke
00:36:01.040 out right you can see that Bitcoin broke
00:36:02.560 out Bitcoin dominance hit a local top
00:36:05.880 right and here again you can see that
00:36:07.319 Bitcoin you know once it broke out
00:36:09.560 Bitcoin dominance basically hit another
00:36:12.000 local top now back then it it still
00:36:15.800 wasn't the top right I mean you can see
00:36:18.280 that you know just a few a few weeks
00:36:20.000 later maybe a month or two later
00:36:21.720 dominance went up and put in a higher
00:36:23.480 high and it and it ultimately just kept
00:36:25.599 on going up so but but it but dominance
00:36:29.040 didn't really start to move
00:36:31.079 again until after Bitcoin sort of got
00:36:34.359 out of this consolidation area right
00:36:38.119 once while Bitcoin was consolidating
00:36:40.400 dominance was generally going down but
00:36:43.440 then once Bitcoin broke out again
00:36:45.440 dominance started to go back up so 60%
00:36:49.079 dominance was always good enough for me
00:36:51.200 to start diversifying there's always a
00:36:53.240 good chance that Bitcoin dominance has
00:36:55.119 in fact topped um I I said that for a
00:36:57.960 long time that 60% was the Milestone uh
00:37:01.480 and certainly with this drop by
00:37:03.359 dominance recently it sort of gives a
00:37:06.520 lot of you know Credence to that idea
00:37:08.920 and in fact if you look at Bitcoin
00:37:10.359 dominance excluding stable coins I
00:37:12.359 mentioned the two paths are either just
00:37:13.880 down now or break out and then go down I
00:37:17.400 didn't really care which one I was going
00:37:18.880 to diversify either way you can see that
00:37:20.920 it looks like it's just immediately
00:37:22.160 broken
00:37:24.359 down right and now it's back below the
00:37:26.640 wedge now there have been times where it
00:37:28.440 was below the wedge but this is the
00:37:29.760 first time we've really had a weekly
00:37:31.280 close below it and you can see that
00:37:33.839 dominance hit the top of this trend line
00:37:36.200 which was always the target excluding
00:37:38.680 stable coins that obviously you know I
00:37:41.520 mean it always corresponded to 65% and
00:37:44.000 including stable coins it corresponded
00:37:46.599 to 60% and the reason I came up with 60%
00:37:50.400 was just sort of assuming that dominance
00:37:52.560 would basically return to where it it
00:37:54.880 broke down from and that's exactly what
00:37:56.680 it did and the other reason was to say
00:37:58.880 look if you look at the FIB retracement
00:38:00.400 tool last cycle Bitcoin dominance topped
00:38:02.920 out at the 618 FIB what if it just does
00:38:05.040 the same thing this cycle and you can
00:38:06.800 see that it it basically went up to the0
00:38:08.640 618 FIB now it's it's basically pulled
00:38:12.839 back here to the 0.5 Fib so let's see
00:38:15.160 what happens
00:38:16.560 here and my guess is you're going to see
00:38:19.520 a reaction by Bitcoin following the
00:38:21.599 labor market
00:38:23.040 release which is all going to be
00:38:24.839 happening this week so
00:38:27.960 to sort of summarize if I can if it's if
00:38:31.280 it's good labor market data and it sort
00:38:33.839 of takes away concerns about the labor
00:38:37.839 market and it it sort of distills any
00:38:40.520 any fears that people might have then
00:38:42.960 it's more likely to see Bitcoin continue
00:38:45.920 to show strength if the unemployment
00:38:48.599 rate comes in higher than expected then
00:38:51.800 or let's say it comes in at at
00:38:53.960 4.2 that's maybe considered somewhat
00:38:56.800 neutral
00:38:58.280 um I could see it going either way
00:39:00.440 honestly I mean I I don't really have a
00:39:02.160 if it's 42 I don't really have a strong
00:39:03.480 opinion right if it's four to 41 that's
00:39:05.400 good if it's 42 it's not really good or
00:39:07.760 bad it's just kind of neutral if it's 43
00:39:10.160 or higher I would argue that's bad you
00:39:12.960 know you don't want to see it go up 210
00:39:16.400 right you don't want to see it go up 210
00:39:17.800 if it goes up 210 then you're basically
00:39:19.480 back to where we were over here all
00:39:21.599 right and if that happens then you could
00:39:23.440 see a rejection off of say that 3 to 3.8
00:39:26.560 to 4% usdt dominance so you could see a
00:39:29.400 rejection off that level and then we
00:39:31.319 sort of regroup and then we try again
00:39:33.200 later on
00:39:35.839 um so those are my general views on on
00:39:40.480 where the market is right now that's
00:39:42.160 sort of the uh the dubious speculation
00:39:44.480 for the video um I don't think I had
00:39:47.640 anything else to
00:39:49.920 mention um that was I think that was
00:39:53.599 essentially it for for this video I
00:39:55.680 don't really think there's any other um
00:39:58.000 um things to to go over let me just
00:40:00.440 double check before I before I sign off
00:40:05.599 here yeah I think that's I think that
00:40:07.800 was mostly what I wanted to cover
00:40:09.119 obviously there's a lot of other charts
00:40:10.280 that we could go through but in the
00:40:11.760 interest of time why don't we just go
00:40:14.079 ahead and and end the video there so
00:40:16.319 hopefully that gives you something to
00:40:17.560 work with right bitcoin's likely in a
00:40:20.200 holding pattern until we start to get
00:40:21.960 that labor market release data which is
00:40:23.880 going to start Tuesday through Friday
00:40:26.440 okay Bitcoin will then look to see at
00:40:28.000 that to see where that data is and then
00:40:30.240 make its decision on on the next move
00:40:33.160 I've tried to outline I mean it's a lot
00:40:34.560 of just if then statements no one can
00:40:36.119 predict the future no one has a crystal
00:40:37.560 ball it's all about having a plan no
00:40:39.640 matter what happens and that's the way I
00:40:41.079 think you navigate the cryptoverse I
00:40:42.920 just use the risk levels rather than try
00:40:44.720 to predict exactly what moves going to
00:40:46.319 happen I give you the dubious
00:40:47.839 speculation just for fun right it's not
00:40:50.319 an investing strategy it's more so just
00:40:52.240 for fun um but remember I just stick to
00:40:55.000 the risk levels and I don't even try to
00:40:57.040 over complicated beyond that but if you

00:00:00.599 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.000 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.440 to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to
00:00:06.319 be discussing the market cycle return on
00:00:09.040 investment or Roi if you guys like the

00:00:19.960 can of course get access to the charts
00:00:21.400 we'll be talking about in this video
00:00:23.840 let's go ahead and jump in now there's
00:00:25.640 three primary ways that I think it makes
00:00:28.960 sense to measure the ROI of Bitcoin some
00:00:32.840 of these ways I haven't always
00:00:35.040 appreciated but the more I've done these
00:00:37.160 videos the more people are like well why
00:00:39.079 don't you measure it like that why don't
00:00:40.440 you measure it like that and I for one
00:00:43.440 do not want to shy away from data I want
00:00:45.160 to look at all of it so what we're going
00:00:47.120 to look at in this video is we're going
00:00:48.680 to look at the ROI of Bitcoin as
00:00:50.360 measured from the low in 2022 the ROI as
00:00:53.399 measured from the peak in 2021 and the
00:00:56.000 ROI after the having that we had earlier
00:00:59.039 this year and I think every single way
00:01:02.199 can give us insight into the current
00:01:04.519 market that if we only looked at in any
00:01:06.640 individual way we might miss okay now
00:01:10.479 the first thing to look at is the ROI
00:01:12.640 from the low there is no mistaking the
00:01:15.640 fact that Bitcoin has developed major
00:01:20.119 lows near the end of midterm years um
00:01:24.520 2014 2018 2022 technically in 2014 bare
00:01:28.280 Market the low actually occurred in
00:01:30.280 January of 2015 but you can see that
00:01:33.079 there were major lows around that time
00:01:36.840 in all of these Cycles right pretty
00:01:39.759 clear now you could also take a low here
00:01:44.320 uh in November of 2011 which was not
00:01:47.040 around the same time in the cycle but
00:01:48.680 that was also really early on in
00:01:50.000 bitcoin's price history let's just look
00:01:52.240 at these three Cycles as measured from
00:01:55.640 the low now one of the things that I
00:01:57.840 mentioned earlier this year back in
00:01:59.520 March was that there was a high chance
00:02:02.320 that Bitcoin had just gotten ahead of
00:02:03.960 schedule and that it would likely slowly
00:02:06.600 bleed until it got back in line with the
00:02:11.038 prior cycles and the reason I said that
00:02:13.879 was because the exact same thing
00:02:15.959 happened the cycle before where it had a
00:02:18.080 rally into the rate cuts and then as
00:02:20.879 those rate Cuts were arriving you can
00:02:22.519 see that Bitcoin sort of sold off and
00:02:25.040 got back in line with the prior cycle
00:02:28.319 and so back in March and April and May
00:02:30.360 and June and July Etc this is what we
00:02:32.760 argued right we said look there's a good
00:02:34.680 chance that bitcoin's just going to
00:02:35.959 slowly bleed and get back in line with
00:02:39.159 the prior Cycles right now what's
00:02:43.360 interesting what's interesting is that
00:02:45.680 it's done that right it's it's done
00:02:48.319 basically exactly what it did last cycle
00:02:52.280 rally up ahead of the last two cycle of
00:02:54.560 the last cycle and then slowly get back
00:02:57.280 in line and you can see that it's done
00:02:58.800 that what's interesting is while Bitcoin
00:03:01.319 has spent a decent amount of time ahead
00:03:03.239 of the last two cycles now it's actually
00:03:05.599 below the last two cycles in terms of
00:03:07.799 Roi from the low now this is updated of
00:03:10.560 obviously on a on a daily basis so you
00:03:14.000 know with with the rally that Bitcoin is
00:03:15.959 experienced today back up to
00:03:18.440 63k it's going to you know have this go
00:03:21.120 back up a little bit but at this point
00:03:23.000 in the last two cycles you know two
00:03:25.120 cycles ago Bitcoin was up about 4.3 6X
00:03:28.200 at this point in the cycle last cycle
00:03:30.159 was up about 4.7 3x at this point in the
00:03:32.640 cycle today it's up 3.8x if you add in
00:03:35.400 the 5% rally that we've had today it's
00:03:37.480 probably going to get you closer to 4X
00:03:39.280 but you can see that Bitcoin has done
00:03:41.760 exactly the same thing that it did last
00:03:43.799 cycle is get ahead of get ahead of
00:03:46.159 itself make everyone scream for an
00:03:48.760 immediate move to all time you know to
00:03:50.319 to 100K but in reality the market just
00:03:54.000 chops around for a while until it's back
00:03:56.480 in line with the prior cycle so then now
00:03:59.120 the question
00:04:00.239 is Will Bitcoin follow those two cycles
00:04:04.680 and go up into
00:04:07.360 Q4 right I mean we're already in Q4 and
00:04:10.040 so far it hasn't really been the best
00:04:12.200 start to to Q4 I mean you know the
00:04:14.720 market hasn't really gone anywhere I
00:04:16.040 think the market opened up around 63k
00:04:18.238 Bitcoin still at 63k although a lot of
00:04:20.839 times you know it's later October when
00:04:23.560 the market um starts to move I I don't I
00:04:26.000 don't remember exactly if it did that
00:04:27.680 last year um last year you can see it
00:04:30.080 was the week of October 16th where the
00:04:31.840 market uh got a strong move up um if you
00:04:35.639 go back
00:04:37.320 to 2020 yeah you can see it was sort of
00:04:40.720 that later October right so that would
00:04:43.039 be that would correspond to maybe next
00:04:44.479 week or the week after if you go back to
00:04:47.199 2019 even there was also in that you
00:04:49.240 know that third to fourth week of
00:04:50.840 October um a big move up right that one
00:04:55.520 ultimately resulted in in a lower high
00:04:58.320 but you still saw a fairly strong move
00:05:01.560 by Bitcoin you know around the third or
00:05:04.639 fourth week of October okay so right
00:05:09.680 now it's
00:05:11.520 unclear if it's not just going to follow
00:05:14.400 what it always does which is you know
00:05:16.440 get a push later on in October now it
00:05:19.039 certainly feels like a push today but
00:05:21.080 you know bitcoin's still basically flat
00:05:22.639 for the week so we'll have to see what
00:05:24.479 happens later on this month so when you
00:05:27.039 measure things from the low when you
00:05:29.840 measure things from the low it looks
00:05:32.840 like
00:05:34.440 Bitcoin is due to start moving up soon
00:05:38.960 if it's going to
00:05:40.360 follow the last two
00:05:42.800 cycles now one thing you might think is
00:05:45.919 well hold on a second Ben you aren't you
00:05:48.280 bearish on on eth in
00:05:51.000 Q4 I am I am and I've I've made the
00:05:54.600 reasons as as as clear as I can the last
00:05:57.600 2 years 2016 2019 when e Bitcoin broke
00:06:00.479 down ethusd dropped in Q4 right I could
00:06:05.479 be wrong about that and that's why I
00:06:07.520 think it it makes sense to hedge right
00:06:09.520 I've said that I mean eth Bitcoin has
00:06:11.280 already gone to 03 to 04 it's there
00:06:12.960 right now right so after all this time
00:06:15.240 people telling me it was it was
00:06:16.560 ridiculous to wait for this range here
00:06:18.319 we are so you know this is a great time
00:06:21.720 to start hedging back especially if eth
00:06:25.039 does not go down in Q4 but I think
00:06:28.720 there's a disc
00:06:30.080 sometimes between my views on eth and my
00:06:31.639 views on bitcoin and I'm hoping that
00:06:33.440 this might help clear it
00:06:35.280 up in
00:06:38.280 2016
00:06:39.880 Q4
00:06:41.720 Bitcoin went up this is this is you know
00:06:45.280 October November December right Q4 2016
00:06:48.639 Bitcoin went up but Q4
00:06:53.639 2016 you might assume that ethereum went
00:06:57.479 up but it actually went down right and
00:07:00.120 it wasn't the only one right there were
00:07:01.280 some other cryptocurrencies that went
00:07:03.199 down back in Q4 of 2016 I don't I'm
00:07:06.360 trying to remember what I mean there's
00:07:07.400 not there were frankly there weren't a
00:07:08.560 lot of cryptocurrencies trading back
00:07:10.039 then uh Litecoin let's see what Litecoin
00:07:12.319 was doing back in um you know if this if
00:07:15.080 this even hous it on the chart um yeah I
00:07:17.360 mean it was going down in Q4 of 2016
00:07:21.000 right
00:07:22.120 so sometimes I think people assume that
00:07:24.840 if it happens for Bitcoin it has to or
00:07:26.560 if it happens for ether it it has to
00:07:28.280 happen for Bitcoin that's not
00:07:30.319 necessarily true right you could have a
00:07:32.960 scenario where Bitcoin goes up in Q4 and
00:07:36.479 and eth does not follow it now I know
00:07:38.639 that might sound crazy right and it and
00:07:41.000 very well very well could be but even
00:07:43.280 today you know if you look at at the
00:07:45.879 monthly return of Bitcoin it's
00:07:49.319 currently basically flat right but it's
00:07:53.840 negative. 56% but for ethereum it's NE
00:07:57.879 55% so you it's not like it's
00:08:01.080 that crazy of an idea right I mean it it
00:08:04.400 could happen and the reason I've talked
00:08:06.280 about it for ethereum is because 2016
00:08:09.319 eth has been a perfect match to 2024 eth
00:08:12.319 so far in terms of monthly candles and
00:08:14.199 back then September was green just like
00:08:16.199 this September was but then October
00:08:17.840 November December were red even though
00:08:19.520 Bitcoin went
00:08:20.759 up this is why Bitcoin dominance is
00:08:23.120 important right it's a it's a statement
00:08:26.680 of I don't know which way bitcoin's
00:08:28.560 going to go
00:08:31.080 but if it goes up I want exposure to it
00:08:34.039 and if it goes down it's probably not
00:08:35.399 going to go down as much as the altcoin
00:08:36.640 market right so it's a good way to have
00:08:40.320 exposure to the
00:08:42.279 upside in crypto while also minimizing
00:08:46.160 your downside risk now one of the
00:08:47.760 interesting things is that you know a
00:08:49.279 lot of people like to compare this cycle
00:08:51.760 to the 2016 cycle and it looks pretty
00:08:54.880 similar right I mean it it you can't
00:08:57.480 deny it
00:09:00.240 it it it looks really similar now
00:09:01.839 obviously it es and flows right so it's
00:09:04.200 always there's always a good chance that
00:09:05.600 it's in the middle of of you know either
00:09:08.279 e or flow where it's you know it was
00:09:10.040 above it now it's kind you know back
00:09:11.440 below it but it's been a pretty good
00:09:14.399 match so far and yes it's below it now
00:09:18.320 but it's also spent a lot of time above
00:09:20.079 it at various points it could just be
00:09:22.680 kind of in this phase where it's back
00:09:24.040 below it again for a
00:09:25.880 while but one of the interesting things
00:09:29.200 with which would support Bitcoin still
00:09:31.440 outperforming the altcoin market for at
00:09:33.480 least for maybe another month or two is
00:09:36.600 the dollar and when you look back at at
00:09:40.839 the dollar in 2016 one of the
00:09:44.519 fascinating things about it in 2016 was
00:09:47.320 that it was also going up in Q4 right I
00:09:49.720 mean here it was weak in August
00:09:51.200 September just like it was over here and
00:09:52.920 then in October the dollar went up 3%
00:09:55.120 November it went up another 3% and then
00:09:56.680 it topped out the following month or two
00:09:58.320 here it's already up 2%
00:10:01.279 which this is important because it shows
00:10:03.320 you it it tells you why there's been
00:10:05.320 this relative weakness by eth against
00:10:08.720 Bitcoin when the dollar goes up net
00:10:11.279 liquidity goes down and that's not good
00:10:13.279 for all Bitcoin pairs it doesn't
00:10:15.000 necessarily mean anything bad for alt
00:10:16.600 USD pairs but for all Bitcoin pairs
00:10:19.279 that's not necessarily a good thing so
00:10:21.880 there's another similarity here with
00:10:24.240 2016 potentially and 2024 where the
00:10:28.000 dollar goes up
00:10:30.880 into the end of the
00:10:34.040 year right so I I think that's an
00:10:36.680 interesting comparison to make now of
00:10:39.959 course there's some nuances to it right
00:10:41.320 I mean just because 2016 looks like 2024
00:10:44.079 in that regard it doesn't mean like it's
00:10:46.000 that way in in every in every comparison
00:10:49.600 and and one of the ways it it has looked
00:10:52.040 different so far although it could get
00:10:53.800 you know it could get back on track is
00:10:55.680 that in 2016 you know there wasn't
00:10:58.240 really the same lower High structure
00:11:00.000 that's developed I mean there were a
00:11:01.160 couple of of of highs where Bitcoin
00:11:03.639 Consolidated from but it it kept on
00:11:05.839 moving up right and here you can see
00:11:07.760 that September was green October was
00:11:09.200 green I mean it it there wasn't this
00:11:11.639 long period of consolidation this long
00:11:14.600 period of consolidation looks a lot more
00:11:16.680 like what we got over here in 2019 which
00:11:19.000 we've been making the comparisons to
00:11:21.040 quite frequently so why does it look
00:11:24.200 different right I think part of it could
00:11:26.639 be the the sort of the macro uner
00:11:29.959 right I mean the dollar the dollar looks
00:11:32.880 very similar in terms of what it's doing
00:11:34.480 right now but perhaps it could be
00:11:36.360 related you know to the um to the
00:11:39.600 unemployment rate and look guys I will
00:11:41.560 be the first to tell you there's not a
00:11:43.240 single person that can predict when a
00:11:44.720 recession is going to occur especially
00:11:46.279 in including me um but I mean it could
00:11:49.279 be that this going up has given it some
00:11:52.279 investors pause and is why Bitcoin has
00:11:55.240 not been moving up like it was in 2016
00:11:58.279 throughout the year because in 2016
00:12:00.560 Bitcoin mostly just went up throughout
00:12:03.160 the entire year whereas in
00:12:05.720 2024 that hasn't really been the case
00:12:08.519 right it it it put in a top in March but
00:12:10.839 then it's been lower highs ever since
00:12:12.519 right if you look at 2016 you know there
00:12:15.920 was there was a high in um you can see
00:12:19.760 that Bitcoin broke out to new highs here
00:12:21.600 in May there was a top in June and then
00:12:24.720 Bitcoin took out the June high in
00:12:26.519 December right but it it just kind of
00:12:28.360 kept on putting in new highs whereas
00:12:31.399 this time it's still just putting in
00:12:33.040 lower highs so I think it's a
00:12:34.720 combination of of the
00:12:37.199 2016 View and the 2019 View and when you
00:12:41.320 when you mix these two views you get
00:12:44.000 something that looks like this where
00:12:45.399 it's kind of a slight downtrend like
00:12:48.320 this but it's not as bad of a
00:12:50.639 downtrend probably because in terms of
00:12:52.680 seasonality it's more so in this range
00:12:56.360 right so remember if Bitcoin does go up
00:12:59.240 in
00:12:59.920 Q4 that's what it did in 2016 and you
00:13:03.160 could have a scenario where eth goes
00:13:05.160 down in Q4 even if Bitcoin goes up
00:13:08.199 doesn't have to be the base case but it
00:13:10.199 could happen now if if Bitcoin goes down
00:13:13.680 in Q4 does that completely derail the
00:13:17.560 whole cycle I would argue that it would
00:13:19.959 not right now first of all there's a
00:13:22.560 good chance it doesn't go down in Q4 if
00:13:25.839 you look at um you know if we go over
00:13:28.760 here to to back to the website and we
00:13:30.880 just look at say quarterly returns right
00:13:33.920 if we look at at at quarterly returns
00:13:36.360 for for Bitcoin in Q4 you know 2020 was
00:13:40.199 green 2016 was green
00:13:44.440 2012 2012 for Bitcoin was green right so
00:13:50.160 they've all been
00:13:51.320 green
00:13:53.360 2019 was red right and that was the year
00:13:56.240 of the FED cut rates so it makes sense
00:13:58.519 to at least keep that in the back of
00:14:00.079 your mind right I'm again I'm not saying
00:14:01.920 that it has to mean that I own Bitcoin
00:14:04.720 guys you know I know I I do I own
00:14:07.120 Bitcoin I I mentioned that I I traded my
00:14:09.199 altcoins to it a few years ago I bought
00:14:11.759 some in late 2022 DCA when the risk
00:14:14.480 level calls for it that's my main crypto
00:14:16.880 portfolio is just Bitcoin and some eth
00:14:20.199 right but I think that right now I mean
00:14:24.120 we're still looking at a red Q4 but
00:14:26.040 we're only you know we're not even two
00:14:27.120 weeks in a lot can change the question
00:14:29.160 question is
00:14:30.320 is if it plays out like the last two
00:14:33.199 cycles then Bitcoin goes up in
00:14:37.880 Q4 you can't ignore it right I mean you
00:14:40.480 can't ignore that view that's what's
00:14:42.320 happened in the last two cycles is that
00:14:44.639 it went up in
00:14:46.120 Q4 of the having
00:14:48.880 year the question I'm asking is what if
00:14:52.360 it doesn't right well you know what if
00:14:54.560 what if
00:14:55.519 Bitcoin you know throws us a curveball
00:14:58.440 and it doesn't
00:14:59.720 and I I don't know what it would look
00:15:01.160 like if it doesn't but soon enough we're
00:15:04.920 going to get into that third week of
00:15:07.360 October third to fourth week which is
00:15:09.839 normally when Bitcoin does pretty well
00:15:11.880 right that I mean even in 2019 you can
00:15:14.720 see that that week of October was pretty
00:15:16.560 bullish um last year it was pretty
00:15:18.720 bullish right 2020 same thing right so
00:15:24.120 bitcoin's main resistance level is going
00:15:27.079 to be coming up somewh up here right you
00:15:29.920 know
00:15:30.720 67k
00:15:32.480 68k if it can get through
00:15:35.399 that then and and and hold that as
00:15:37.959 support then you're probably just
00:15:39.560 looking at a at a Q4 having year that
00:15:42.319 looks like every other Q4 having year
00:15:44.240 and everyone's just trying to over
00:15:45.319 complicate it if it's rejected right if
00:15:49.560 it's rejected let's say Bitcoin rallies
00:15:52.279 up into it and then you know there's a
00:15:55.480 bad a bad data point somewhere and then
00:15:58.000 the market gets spooked again kind of
00:15:59.560 like it got spooked over here this was
00:16:01.440 at the beginning of a month you know
00:16:02.800 when the labor market data come out this
00:16:04.480 came out this was to um you know this
00:16:07.360 was as well and so if it if it sells off
00:16:11.839 again does that derail the
00:16:15.279 cycle I would say no right I would say
00:16:18.079 no so and the reason I would say no is
00:16:21.319 because if you look at the ROI from the
00:16:24.680 low we would expect diminishing returns
00:16:27.240 right so it's not like it has to keep
00:16:28.639 pace with this cycle right if it follows
00:16:31.079 what 2019 ended up doing that's fine
00:16:34.839 right it's fine for it to do that I said
00:16:36.399 six to9 months it's already been seven
00:16:38.440 months so it could be that the low is in
00:16:41.399 for Bitcoin for this year or maybe you
00:16:44.079 get one more low or low but that doesn't
00:16:46.399 necessarily mean it's going to derail
00:16:47.920 the entire cycle if that happens the
00:16:50.480 reason why you could argue that view is
00:16:53.880 because first of all there is an e and
00:16:55.399 flow to this but if you measure the ROI
00:16:58.360 after the cycle
00:17:01.000 Peak bitcoin's currently ahead of the
00:17:03.399 last two cycles and if you look at it
00:17:05.760 you know just as measured from a from
00:17:07.400 November 2021 it's actually back to
00:17:09.799 where the the last cycle was at this
00:17:12.199 point in the cycle but what's really
00:17:14.199 fascinating is when you compare to the
00:17:16.480 2016 cycle it's still very much ahead of
00:17:20.880 where it
00:17:22.039 was in that cycle at this point in the
00:17:25.799 cycle as measured from the peak right
00:17:28.160 now bitco coin is is basically 7% down
00:17:31.919 from the all-time high but in 2016 cycle
00:17:34.880 it was still 37% down from the all-time
00:17:39.000 high right 37% down from the 2021
00:17:43.720 high would put Bitcoin at 42k right I
00:17:47.160 mean it would put it all the way back
00:17:48.840 down here
00:17:51.200 again which again would be near the 100
00:17:53.600 we moving average right so this is how I
00:17:57.960 think it you know it makes sense to play
00:17:59.440 it right and I I've said this for years
00:18:01.559 right I've said this for
00:18:03.080 years Bitcoin heavy still makes sense to
00:18:05.760 me right I still think dominance is
00:18:07.679 going to 60% I think it makes sense to
00:18:09.880 hedge with some other stuff uh you know
00:18:12.440 some some altcoins that are doing well
00:18:14.320 in their Bitcoin pairs absolutely I
00:18:16.480 think it makes sense to hedge I want to
00:18:18.159 be clear um but I I still do think that
00:18:21.039 Bitcoin dominance will go to that 60%
00:18:23.200 Milestone you got the dollar going up so
00:18:25.200 you got net liquidity Going Down The
00:18:26.520 Long of the Y curve is going up and
00:18:28.400 normally that and and with rate Cuts
00:18:30.520 with some of the aggressive rate cuts
00:18:31.880 that we're getting priced in now some of
00:18:33.600 those are getting priced back out so to
00:18:35.520 me it would seem to favor that Bitcoin
00:18:37.760 outperforms the question is is it on a
00:18:39.720 Bitcoin Rally or is it a bit on a
00:18:41.120 Bitcoin dump throughout this year it's
00:18:43.280 been on both right I mean Bitcoin
00:18:45.720 bitcoin's basically just been going
00:18:47.400 sideways with a slightly bearish bias
00:18:49.799 and while that has been going on bitcoin
00:18:51.720 dominance has just been going
00:18:54.760 up so you could get a scenario right I I
00:18:57.480 think the two the the two scenarios that
00:18:59.760 I think
00:19:01.039 deserve the most attention right the
00:19:03.600 most attention because I wish I could
00:19:05.039 tell you the outcome right but the two
00:19:07.919 scenarios that I think deserve the most
00:19:10.520 attention are these two and I I'll draw
00:19:13.360 both of them out and and these are the
00:19:15.240 two that I'm looking at um one of which
00:19:19.320 is you know sort of a rally back up and
00:19:22.679 then there's a pullback early November
00:19:25.799 and then it gets above it holds it as
00:19:27.720 support and then it just continues on
00:19:30.039 right that's one view the other view is
00:19:33.400 where Bitcoin follows ethereum down if
00:19:36.240 ethereum does what it did in 2016 and in
00:19:38.159 2019 after eth Bitcoin broke down eth
00:19:40.640 USD dropped approximately 70% if it and
00:19:43.840 it and the final drop occurred in Q4 if
00:19:46.000 Bitcoin follows
00:19:47.400 eth because maybe the unemployment
00:19:49.440 rate's going up so it's more so
00:19:50.720 dependent on that than it is the
00:19:52.799 dollar then it could get rejected come
00:19:55.679 back down one more time check in with a
00:19:57.679 100 we SMA like 2019 and then go up in
00:20:01.000 2025 right so there's two scenarios that
00:20:04.320 I think deserve the most attention right
00:20:07.840 now now I told you guys this back over
00:20:10.760 here in you know in July I said that for
00:20:14.840 the 2019 comparison to be complete we
00:20:18.000 need another lower low at the bottom of
00:20:20.240 this trend line and people are like no
00:20:23.240 way right there's no way bitcoin's going
00:20:24.640 to go to 50K and then it did and this is
00:20:27.799 why I said we need at least 6 months we
00:20:30.120 got it right we got it but I said 6 to 9
00:20:35.039 months I don't know if that's the low it
00:20:38.520 could be right or if there has to be one
00:20:41.039 more because in 2019 after the low was
00:20:43.960 in right after the 2019 view played out
00:20:46.320 there still was a landing right now I
00:20:49.880 don't think you're going to get a
00:20:51.240 pandemic style drop right but you could
00:20:53.919 still get a landing right a soft landing
00:20:57.360 and and I I think that that is the
00:20:59.000 important thing to look at here is is
00:21:00.520 does that actually happen again uh in Q4
00:21:03.559 and how strong is Bitcoin going to be if
00:21:06.559 the unemployment rate starts to go back
00:21:08.080 up at the end of the year could it shrug
00:21:11.880 it off is there enough liquidity in the
00:21:13.799 altcoin market to send Bitcoin higher or
00:21:16.200 does it sell off one final time before
00:21:19.279 then going up in you know in 2025 I
00:21:22.200 think those are the two most likely
00:21:23.840 scenarios to look at but the thing is is
00:21:26.480 if you measure it from the low it might
00:21:28.840 make you think that it has to go up or
00:21:32.080 the cycle gets derailed but if you look
00:21:34.120 at it from the peak you're like we got
00:21:36.000 plenty of time right we got we got tons
00:21:38.400 of wiggle room here right Bitcoin could
00:21:40.360 go sideways as they you know 1,68
00:21:42.799 Bitcoin could go sideways for another
00:21:45.159 150 days and still be on track with 2016
00:21:48.720 2017 cycle right that's how aggressive
00:21:52.159 this move was by Bitcoin earlier on in
00:21:55.039 the cycle it's also true that it didn't
00:21:56.159 drop as much as it did in 2016
00:21:59.360 so I think you got to look at that right
00:22:01.279 you got to look at that and say you know
00:22:04.279 what bitcoin's still in pretty good
00:22:06.400 shape All Things Considered you know
00:22:09.279 it's it had a really great rally early
00:22:11.440 on it it has struggled in
00:22:14.960 20124 to really continue its move up but
00:22:18.440 when you look at it from the low it
00:22:20.120 makes absolute sense why it did it's
00:22:22.600 because it was so far ahead of the last
00:22:24.679 two cycles because when it was up here
00:22:27.440 right when when this cycle
00:22:29.039 was up here at you know 4 and 1/2x From
00:22:31.799 The Bottom the other two cycles were
00:22:33.480 still only 2 to 2 and 1/2x from the
00:22:35.320 bottom so Bitcoin has gone sideways with
00:22:38.039 a slightly bearish bias for seven
00:22:40.840 months now it's back in line with the
00:22:43.799 prior Cycles right so I would say it
00:22:47.039 like this you know I would say if if the
00:22:49.919 unemployment rate keeps dropping in Q4
00:22:52.840 it would probably favor risk assets to
00:22:56.159 still do well right and you could see
00:22:57.679 Bitcoin go up and Q4 now technically eth
00:23:00.080 could go up in Q4 too but I think the
00:23:02.400 issue with that is it's more so
00:23:04.120 dependent on looser monetary policy than
00:23:06.679 Bitcoin is and so if the labor market
00:23:08.520 data comes in better than expected it
00:23:10.679 could just delay rate cuts which I think
00:23:12.440 things like ethereum are really relying
00:23:13.960 on more so than Bitcoin right I don't
00:23:15.960 really think Bitcoin is relying on it as
00:23:18.039 much as as eth but if the unemployment
00:23:21.400 rate say shoots back up in you know next
00:23:25.000 month um then then you might actually
00:23:27.799 see Bitcoin and eth go back down and
00:23:30.960 then go back up after you know after we
00:23:33.200 get that scare out of the
00:23:35.760 way but I thought that those were two
00:23:38.000 really good ways to look at the market
00:23:39.880 right look at it from the low and say
00:23:41.960 everyone's trying to over complicate
00:23:43.360 this thing and they have been all year
00:23:45.279 but in reality this chart would have
00:23:46.799 told you Bitcoin needs to get back in
00:23:48.320 line with the prior cycles and then it's
00:23:49.559 got a real chance of moving up now it's
00:23:51.320 back in line with the last two cycles
00:23:53.600 and you know it's got a chance it's got
00:23:55.400 a chance here to move back up to this
00:23:56.840 trend line before the end of of
00:23:59.559 October right there's a
00:24:02.440 chance if it doesn't right and if it
00:24:04.799 just sells off again then I think you go
00:24:08.600 to the next view
00:24:10.480 Roi after the
00:24:12.640 peak and that'll show you that there's
00:24:15.080 still plenty of of you know wiggle room
00:24:20.200 here right I mean again at this point in
00:24:22.240 the last cycle Bitcoin was still 37%
00:24:24.200 down from the high and that would put it
00:24:25.559 at like 44k or something right so
00:24:29.200 it shows
00:24:30.399 you it makes sense to look at it in more
00:24:33.120 than one way sometimes now some people
00:24:35.159 previously were looking at it as
00:24:36.480 measured from April and I took a look at
00:24:38.039 it a few times because everyone was
00:24:39.480 talking about it they were talking about
00:24:40.760 a massive rally with an early Peak uh
00:24:43.679 let's say like earlier this summer a lot
00:24:45.840 of the you know a lot of the gurus were
00:24:47.520 calling for 100k by the summer right and
00:24:50.240 they were wrong and now they're just
00:24:52.000 kind of they just keep saying it but
00:24:53.840 look guys you have to be careful with
00:24:55.679 this stuff just because it's tracking a
00:24:57.200 cycle like that does not mean it has to
00:24:58.960 continue doing it and you can see that
00:25:01.000 it hasn't right and a lot of people have
00:25:03.320 gotten chopped up in here because every
00:25:05.399 time it it goes up they buy a lot
00:25:08.320 thinking it's going to go to 100K
00:25:09.799 because everyone's telling them it is
00:25:11.399 and then it sells off and they panicked
00:25:12.799 at the bottom and sell if you just you
00:25:15.640 know if you just St Bitcoin heavy for
00:25:17.240 the last three years who cares right it
00:25:19.919 doesn't matter you just assume that
00:25:21.760 Bitcoin dominance is going to go up and
00:25:23.360 most everything else in the cryptoverse
00:25:24.640 is going to bleed back to bitcoin as
00:25:26.240 Bitcoin makes its way to a dominance of
00:25:29.120 60% so when you measure it from April
00:25:32.559 you know we've already fallen behind the
00:25:35.000 last two cycles but I think you you need
00:25:36.399 to measure it from November I think
00:25:38.080 price action is King not the indicators
00:25:39.919 that tell you where the price was topped
00:25:41.880 where did price actually top and it was
00:25:43.320 in November 2021 not in April just like
00:25:46.120 the bare Market was from November to
00:25:48.360 November back then not not April to
00:25:50.559 April price action is King the last way
00:25:53.600 to measure the ROI is from the having
00:25:55.559 and this is probably the most
00:25:56.960 disappointing one we've had um because
00:25:59.240 you can see that you know Bitcoin even I
00:26:02.240 mean right now it's still
00:26:04.440 underperforming um the last several
00:26:06.760 cycles and it's basically right around
00:26:08.480 Break Even okay this has not been the
00:26:12.039 best Roi for Bitcoin after the having
00:26:14.399 counterpoints is this is really the
00:26:15.799 first cycle out the last two that
00:26:17.600 Bitcoin sell new all-time highs before
00:26:19.320 the having so it Mak sense that it was
00:26:21.120 been a little bit weaker after the
00:26:22.559 having um so you know you'd really like
00:26:26.640 to see that get back in line because
00:26:28.440 measure from the having Bitcoin is
00:26:30.520 really far behind it's it's still at
00:26:34.440 97 and last two cycles at this point we
00:26:37.279 at 1.47 and 1.6 so what's going on right
00:26:41.240 what's going on why is this why is that
00:26:43.240 weakness there I think a lot of it is
00:26:45.480 you know I think the ETFs brought
00:26:47.159 forward a lot of the demand and has then
00:26:49.760 led to this long consolidation period um
00:26:53.320 but also I imagine that liquidity has
00:26:56.520 had something to do with it right you
00:26:57.640 know just the fed reducing balance
00:26:59.520 sheets and and and um and also macro
00:27:03.320 uncertainties probably had something to
00:27:04.520 do with it but you can see that this is
00:27:06.320 this has played out very similar to 2019
00:27:08.240 because just like 2019 while Bitcoin
00:27:10.320 trended down the S&P just kept putting
00:27:11.960 in new all-time highs and and so that's
00:27:14.000 why it makes sense to be di Diversified
00:27:16.640 because otherwise you find yourself in a
00:27:18.200 position where you know the S&P has been
00:27:19.919 going up for seven months straight
00:27:21.399 bitcoin's been going down for S months
00:27:22.960 straight if you've been Diversified some
00:27:24.840 at least you would have you know at
00:27:25.840 least your portfolio hasn't been flat
00:27:27.440 for the last six months
00:27:28.760 or slightly down um that's why I think
00:27:31.200 it makes sense to to diversify and
00:27:32.600 there's also no guarantees with any of
00:27:33.880 this stuff right I mean things can
00:27:35.799 happen bad things can happen um you can
00:27:38.159 get major sell-offs when you least
00:27:39.799 expect it and that's what happened last
00:27:41.440 cycle right I mean there was a the
00:27:43.279 pandemic drop which no one was expecting
00:27:45.760 and then we we pretty quickly recovered
00:27:47.679 and got back on our merry way so for me
00:27:51.240 right now I think it makes sense to look
00:27:53.159 at it as measure from the low and say
00:27:54.760 look there's a decent chance Bitcoin
00:27:56.360 just gets a rally in Q4
00:27:58.679 if it doesn't and it gets rejected by
00:28:02.080 the top of this you know this descending
00:28:04.039 broadening wedge right if it just gets
00:28:05.559 rejected again then I think you just go
00:28:09.159 and say look guys if you measure from
00:28:11.240 the
00:28:12.720 peak it would still fall in line with
00:28:15.720 the 2016 cycle um and and it would just
00:28:19.559 kind of be the the the it would actually
00:28:21.200 be completing the end of the 2019
00:28:23.279 pattern right so the 2019 pattern has
00:28:25.519 fully played out right it's fully played
00:28:28.120 play out the thing that hasn't played
00:28:30.080 out is is there a landing or not right
00:28:32.360 is there a soft Landing is there a hard
00:28:34.039 Landing um and and I think that if if
00:28:37.360 that plays out you know maybe after the
00:28:39.559 election or something um then perhaps
00:28:43.320 that would open the door for for 2025
00:28:45.840 for Bitcoin dominance to go down as then
00:28:48.039 you know there would be a lot more
00:28:48.880 looser monetary policy coming in to you
00:28:51.360 know hopefully save the day and and and
00:28:53.360 send the unemployment rate back down but
00:28:55.240 I do think that this stuff is is really
00:28:57.080 interesting to look at it it helps you
00:28:59.039 view the market in in different ways and
00:29:01.120 look I think a lot of people only want
00:29:03.200 to hear the bullish view or they only
00:29:05.120 want to hear the bearish view but the
00:29:07.399 reality is both sides have you know have
00:29:09.840 been right and both sides have been
00:29:11.159 wrong uh for basically the last seven
00:29:13.720 months right and so it makes sense to
00:29:16.200 have a Balan view and say you know
00:29:19.080 what we're getting close to the time
00:29:21.360 where seasonality tends to be favorable
00:29:23.240 for Bitcoin um and so maybe if it if
00:29:26.640 it's going to break out if it's is going
00:29:28.279 to break out this year it seems like it
00:29:29.720 should do it soon um because you got
00:29:32.240 other ones breaking out right I mean you
00:29:33.760 got other thing I mean look the S&P is
00:29:35.559 putting a new highs again
00:29:37.840 um so I would watch this let's see what
00:29:41.960 happens up here if if Bitcoin can break
00:29:45.919 through or if it or if it just sells off
00:29:48.880 again um and
00:29:50.880 remember e could still go down in Q4
00:29:54.799 even if Bitcoin doesn't it's hard to
00:29:58.360 make that the base case just because eth
00:30:01.000 Bitcoin has already sold off a lot and
00:30:03.120 so I mean while it's possible it could
00:30:04.640 go a little bit lower I don't think it's
00:30:05.880 going to go that much slower but you
00:30:08.000 know anything anything's possible Right
00:30:10.240 anything's possible so I would look at
00:30:11.519 those two scenarios breaking through
00:30:13.799 kind of right now or one more Landing
00:30:16.760 sell off and then breaking through and
00:30:18.919 then just comparing to these Roi from
00:30:20.840 the low Roi from the peak and seeing
00:30:23.519 which one it it tends to follow better

00:00:00.719 hey everyone thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.200 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.759 to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to
00:00:06.640 be discussing the terminal price if you
00:00:09.240 guys like the content make sure you
00:00:10.759 subscribe to the channel give the video
00:00:12.040 a thumbs up and check out the sale on
00:00:14.200 into the cryptoverse premium add into
00:00:16.600 the cryptoverse
00:00:18.439 docomo ahead and jump in so before we
00:00:21.920 talk too much about the indicator and
00:00:25.439 defining what it means as always we have
00:00:28.240 to give credit where credit is due it's
00:00:30.279 an important thing to do when you're
00:00:32.200 talking about an indicator especially
00:00:34.120 one that is not yours this indicator was
00:00:36.600 created by cchm and David PE in November
00:00:42.480 of 2021 it appears so what I'd like to
00:00:47.039 do is before we really get into this we
00:00:50.239 got to Define everything so really this
00:00:52.520 indicator is a couple of different ones
00:00:54.480 right it's the terminal price and the
00:00:56.160 balance price now the terminal price has
00:00:57.800 been useful for helping to identify tops
00:01:00.079 the balance price has been useful for
00:01:02.000 helping to identify bottoms right
00:01:04.680 Bitcoin normally bottoms out around the
00:01:07.720 balance price and it normally tops out
00:01:10.720 around the terminal price so the
00:01:13.119 terminal price
00:01:15.040 is kind of difficult to understand if
00:01:18.000 you haven't looked at some of these
00:01:19.240 terms before but we're going to try to
00:01:21.400 Define it and we're going to go one step
00:01:23.079 at a time so we first must understand a
00:01:27.119 concept called transferred price now the
00:01:30.000 transferred and these these we're s
00:01:31.920 going to have definitions nested within
00:01:34.040 definitions but the transferred price is
00:01:36.600 just simply equal to the cumulative
00:01:39.200 value days destroyed divided by the
00:01:42.479 market age times Supply now value days
00:01:46.320 destroyed is defined as price times coin
00:01:50.240 days destroyed clear as mud right but we
00:01:53.119 can actually go Define coin days
00:01:55.119 destroyed right so coin days destroyed
00:01:56.680 is another indicator and one of the
00:01:59.280 things about coin days destroyed is that
00:02:02.560 you will see major spikes around pretty
00:02:05.840 volatile moments in the cryptoverse
00:02:07.680 right you got a ma you get major spikes
00:02:10.080 at at tops and at bottoms we also got a
00:02:12.879 major spike at the midcycle top last
00:02:15.360 cycle we got a major spike at the
00:02:17.400 midcycle top this cycle so coin days
00:02:21.200 destroyed and of itself is an
00:02:23.200 interesting indicator but it's defined
00:02:26.200 as the sum of all Native units
00:02:28.760 transferred that day
00:02:30.480 multiplied by the amount of money or the
00:02:32.280 amount of days since those native units
00:02:34.360 were last transferred so for instance if
00:02:37.319 you have five Bitcoin in a wallet for 20
00:02:40.040 days then 100 coin days are
00:02:43.480 created so when those coins are
00:02:46.120 spent then you have 100 coin days
00:02:48.840 destroyed so
00:02:52.159 remember transferred price is equal to
00:02:55.560 Value days destroyed which is price time
00:02:58.519 coin days destroyed divided by the
00:03:00.640 market cap or divided by the market age
00:03:03.000 time Supply the market age is just
00:03:05.519 defined as the amount of days since the
00:03:06.840 first price data point and the
00:03:09.280 transferred price can be seen as a life
00:03:12.040 toate moving average of spending
00:03:14.280 Behavior now that is defining something
00:03:16.840 that isn't even the thing we're trying
00:03:18.680 to Define it's just making up the thing
00:03:20.640 we're trying to define the terminal
00:03:23.120 price which is what we're interested in
00:03:25.239 in this video is equal to 21 time the
00:03:29.319 transfer
00:03:31.200 price okay so that is how the terminal
00:03:34.319 price is created and you can see if you
00:03:37.360 sort of zoom in at prior
00:03:39.519 tops the the the actual top for Bitcoin
00:03:42.760 occurs around where the terminal price
00:03:45.239 is okay now in the first cycle you can
00:03:47.799 see it got above it a couple of times
00:03:49.720 before the actual top was in and in 2013
00:03:53.560 it actually got above it a couple of
00:03:55.200 times before the actual top was in you
00:03:57.400 look at 2017 once it was above it the
00:04:00.079 top was in and if you look at 2021 it
00:04:03.760 did get AB get above it a couple of
00:04:05.560 times before the top was in but the
00:04:07.799 actual top occurred much lower than the
00:04:10.599 terminal price you know much lower than
00:04:12.959 it was and I I think that second top
00:04:15.319 really threw a lot of people off
00:04:18.000 guard now one of the things that I've
00:04:20.680 mentioned and you can kind of see it in
00:04:22.759 this indicator as well is diminished
00:04:26.840 volatility we've done a lot of videos
00:04:29.000 recently where we've seen this very
00:04:31.639 concept right one of those is if you go
00:04:35.440 look at the P Cycle top we did a video
00:04:37.280 on this where it seems like every time
00:04:40.240 these moving averages cross they cross a
00:04:42.919 little bit less spectacularly right I
00:04:45.919 mean you know they used to cross a lot
00:04:48.600 last cycle they barely crossed so if you
00:04:51.400 divide the moving averages you'll notice
00:04:54.759 that in order for it to cross one it
00:04:56.680 would have to go back to where it was
00:04:58.000 last cycle but every cycle has seen
00:05:00.639 lower and lower Peaks so you might get a
00:05:03.560 situation where everyone's waiting for
00:05:05.960 it to Signal by going back up to one but
00:05:09.479 it never actually signals because you
00:05:11.440 can see the lower highs in this metric
00:05:15.039 right something to keep in mind now if
00:05:18.520 you look at the stock to flow it was a
00:05:21.319 similar thing right we did a whole video
00:05:22.759 on this as well where if you look at the
00:05:25.639 stock to flow what you'll notice is the
00:05:28.000 Orange Line the price was you know first
00:05:31.199 got closer and closer to it and then now
00:05:33.759 it's getting further and further away
00:05:35.319 from it so if you take the deflection
00:05:37.800 you can also again see the lower high
00:05:39.800 structure so what I'm suggesting is the
00:05:43.759 extent at which it's going above the
00:05:46.280 terminal price seems to be diminishing
00:05:49.319 from one cycle to another and so if you
00:05:52.039 take the price of Bitcoin divided by
00:05:54.919 that metric you get something that looks
00:05:57.360 like this
00:06:00.440 and what's really interesting
00:06:03.240 is
00:06:05.240 initially we
00:06:07.039 saw it going above about the same amount
00:06:09.960 right you know for the first few Cycles
00:06:12.039 but at least you know if you measure it
00:06:13.919 from here to here to here but if you
00:06:16.319 ignore that first data point then we've
00:06:20.080 basically had lower
00:06:22.199 highs as measured when you're looking at
00:06:25.360 the the price of Bitcoin divided by that
00:06:27.240 metric so for instance if we were to go
00:06:29.319 over here and just simply draw a trend
00:06:32.120 line through these Peaks you can see
00:06:34.880 there is a chance that it doesn't
00:06:37.440 actually make it up to one which is
00:06:39.440 where the terminal price would be hit so
00:06:41.919 I just want people to have that in mind
00:06:43.560 it doesn't mean that it can't make it up
00:06:45.280 there right it doesn't mean that it
00:06:46.520 can't it it very well could get back up
00:06:49.240 to that level if it were to follow say
00:06:51.280 the trend from the first couple of
00:06:53.360 Cycles where it just kind of goes right
00:06:55.039 back up to where it was so do keep that
00:06:58.560 in mind it doesn't NE necessarily have
00:07:00.160 to follow the diminished Peak outcome
00:07:03.479 but I just want people to be aware that
00:07:06.280 the diminished Peak outcome is an
00:07:09.160 outcome that should at least be on your
00:07:11.280 radar right and if it were to continue
00:07:13.120 like this perhaps it would get up to
00:07:15.360 about 0.9 which is really interesting
00:07:18.160 because if you do the P Cycle top
00:07:19.680 diminish Peaks it also shows about 0.9
00:07:22.919 rather than rather than one so that's
00:07:24.960 just something to keep in mind right now
00:07:27.240 the terminal price according and again
00:07:29.199 this is not my metric um it was created
00:07:32.120 by you know you can see the creators
00:07:33.520 here Chuck M and David
00:07:35.360 PE right now the terminal pric is at
00:07:39.000 188k um so just keep those you know keep
00:07:42.440 those numbers in mind if um you know if
00:07:46.080 if at some point in the next few months
00:07:49.360 or year you're seeing the price of
00:07:51.440 Bitcoin get close to that value then
00:07:55.360 just keep in mind that historically
00:07:57.919 there's not much more higher to go in
00:08:00.039 the cycle um the other thing to remember
00:08:03.199 as well is that all models are wrong
00:08:06.440 some are useful and a lot of times you
00:08:09.720 know when I create my own models I sort
00:08:11.199 of try to assume okay it's probably
00:08:13.159 going to be wrong why is it wrong and a
00:08:15.680 lot of people give a lot of models you
00:08:18.120 know a bad R because they they miss
00:08:21.360 something right but rather rather than
00:08:25.479 look and call it a failure or a success
00:08:28.840 just simply based on if it crosses a
00:08:31.000 certain threshold I would encourage you
00:08:33.159 to dig deeper into the metrics right you
00:08:36.080 know look at it in in a different way
00:08:38.320 and that's when you can sort of see
00:08:39.640 these Trends emerge that otherwise you
00:08:42.719 might not have noticed right taking the
00:08:45.240 deflection from the price and the metric
00:08:48.720 that you're looking at the same thing
00:08:50.080 goes again with what we were talking
00:08:51.839 about a few days ago the pi cycle top
00:08:54.480 and dividing those moving averages and
00:08:56.360 then just seeing those diminished Peaks
00:08:58.600 we've seen it actually many many times
00:09:01.200 across a lot of indicators throughout
00:09:03.279 the years right if you go look at at say
00:09:05.880 the extension the natural log of the
00:09:08.040 price over the 20we moving average we've
00:09:09.920 seen something very similar where the
00:09:12.160 extension from the 20we moving average
00:09:14.519 from one cycle to another tends to
00:09:17.399 diminish that doesn't mean that the
00:09:19.640 price of Bitcoin can't go higher that
00:09:21.600 cycle just because it hits that top
00:09:24.040 right if you look at it here you can see
00:09:26.519 that it it tagged this trend line back
00:09:29.120 in in March but obviously the price of
00:09:32.160 Bitcoin is higher now this was one of
00:09:34.440 the reasons why I said back over here
00:09:36.600 that the market needed to cool off for a
00:09:38.240 little while because the extension
00:09:40.079 beyond the 20we moving average suggested
00:09:43.079 it was time for a cool down so just keep
00:09:45.680 in mind and even last cycle right last
00:09:47.480 cycle you can see that it had a couple
00:09:49.240 of tags on the trend line in 2013 it had
00:09:51.560 a couple of tags on the trend line so
00:09:53.760 just remember that there there's a lot
00:09:57.040 of times even with models that you don't
00:09:59.680 necessarily like you can still find
00:10:02.800 Value in them if you're willing to look
00:10:06.720 so in the terminal price case I think
00:10:09.800 yeah like look at this terminal price
00:10:12.000 and see if it gives some validity but
00:10:14.800 also look at the the trend of it you
00:10:18.440 know in 2013 it crossed it pretty
00:10:21.640 aggressively 2017 not as much 2021
00:10:26.000 barely crossed you know what happens if
00:10:28.399 this time everyone's waiting for it to
00:10:30.480 cross and then it just barely misses it
00:10:33.760 you know so just something to keep in
00:10:35.800 mind we're going to keep this video
00:10:37.079 relatively short if you guys like the

00:00:38.280 basically just going to go through some
00:00:39.360 questions fairly quickly and then we
00:00:41.280 will take some audience questions feel
00:00:43.039 free to go ahead and ask those questions

00:00:49.719 but let's go ahead and get started I
00:00:51.280 mean it it seems like there's been some
00:00:55.120 increasing interest in the crypto space
00:00:58.359 uh for the last like weeks or so
00:01:02.280 um so I'm curious you know I mean
00:01:05.239 obviously there was the election results
00:01:07.360 about six weeks ago have you guys you
00:01:09.920 know just anecdotally we could always
00:01:11.520 like go to the data but anecdotally have
00:01:14.759 you you know have do you see any
00:01:17.320 interest picking up kind of in your neck
00:01:19.159 of the woods in crypto like are people
00:01:21.000 starting to sort of ask questions about
00:01:23.439 it are your friends or your family
00:01:25.079 asking questions about it um I'm kind of
00:01:27.320 curious it's kind of an interesting way
00:01:28.520 to gauge where we are in the cycle like
00:01:30.600 who's asking you know who's asking about
00:01:32.840 it and and who's not asking about it guy
00:01:35.000 we'll start with you on this one what
00:01:36.360 what what are your anecdotes for recent
00:01:39.000 interest in
00:01:41.040 crypto yeah this is interesting I always
00:01:43.560 find I always find it fascinating you
00:01:45.280 know sort of when if people are talking
00:01:47.280 about it and if they are talking about
00:01:48.840 it what they're actually saying um and
00:01:51.280 for the past couple of weeks I um last
00:01:53.439 week in the week before I was back in
00:01:54.920 the UK so I was very sort of keen to to
00:01:57.560 get a read from family and friends um so
00:02:01.719 I went to a big I went to a big 40th my
00:02:03.840 first weekend back and I spoke to a
00:02:05.439 couple of guys about it there and they
00:02:08.679 were sort of kind of aware that that
00:02:12.400 that things were looking up um one guy
00:02:15.640 uh asked me how xrp was doing and I said
00:02:18.640 pretty well actually and he was oh
00:02:21.000 that's great I've had a massive bag of
00:02:22.840 that since about 2017 so I was like you
00:02:27.040 may want to check that that's that
00:02:28.680 that's probably looking better than when
00:02:30.040 you last uh checked it um but what was
00:02:32.920 interesting was like I talked to a
00:02:34.040 couple of sorry I was going to say did
00:02:36.480 you tell them the price is the same it
00:02:38.000 was in
00:02:41.480 2017 way to dump on everybody Ben way to
00:02:44.159 dump on everybody nice I I couldn't do
00:02:47.360 that to him I couldn't do that to him um
00:02:49.800 but I said yeah certainly it's uh
00:02:51.440 certainly it's it's improved it's
00:02:53.120 improved a lot um and I spoke to a
00:02:55.920 couple of other guys about it and
00:02:57.440 because there were a few people there
00:02:58.480 that I hadn't seen for a while and they
00:03:00.080 were sort of like oh you know what are
00:03:01.360 you up to these days and I was like well
00:03:03.280 you know doing crypto in Dubai and they
00:03:05.159 oh crypto and what it what it kind of
00:03:08.159 told me was like from from what they
00:03:09.680 said and the questions they asked I was
00:03:11.480 like these guys they they don't know
00:03:14.680 anything about it and that's not a
00:03:16.040 reflection on them you know they're not
00:03:17.480 like you know they they're they're all
00:03:18.959 smart they were all smart people but it
00:03:20.799 was it was sort of like yeah crypto so
00:03:23.920 bitcoin's the big one isn't it it's like
00:03:25.400 yeah yeah bitcoin's the big one then and
00:03:26.799 then it's uh what's the other one
00:03:28.120 ethereum right it's like wow this is
00:03:31.239 this is going to be a long so how deep
00:03:33.720 do you want to go so yeah they were kind
00:03:36.280 of aware but like you know very unawares
00:03:39.920 and I I felt there quite a long way to
00:03:41.680 go but what was interesting I I then um
00:03:44.480 was with my parents for a week and in
00:03:46.120 the space of a single day my parents had
00:03:48.439 some people around and they were asking
00:03:50.720 about Bitcoin and they oh it's it's just
00:03:53.280 part it's it's just got $100,000 hasn't
00:03:55.680 it yep yep that's true um isn't there a
00:03:58.439 chap who lost it all and it's in a
00:04:00.599 rubbish dump somewhere I like yep yep
00:04:03.000 that's absolutely right y okay and then
00:04:06.680 uh um Katie and I went to went to the
00:04:09.439 pub for a couple of drinks uh that
00:04:11.239 evening and there were some people at
00:04:12.840 the end of the bar and I kind of
00:04:14.200 overheard them and they were like how
00:04:15.760 about that Bitcoin a that Bitcoin yeah
00:04:18.639 yeah I yeah it's something like under
00:04:20.839 100K dollars for one now you hear about
00:04:23.680 that bloke who threw it all out and it's
00:04:25.800 stuck in the landfill like this this
00:04:28.919 James H's guy is now like a main
00:04:31.280 character um without uh without
00:04:33.840 realizing it but yeah like that yeah so
00:04:36.120 kind of people are aware um people are
00:04:39.479 sort of talking about it again but I
00:04:41.479 kind of got the impression you know just
00:04:43.360 for a very small sample size in the UK I
00:04:46.639 kind of got the impression it's it's
00:04:48.160 starting to register but really the the
00:04:51.639 nuances of it you know it's like there's
00:04:53.919 Bitcoin and then there's there's a load
00:04:55.400 of other stuff isn't there oh and
00:04:57.320 there's a you know um there's a hawk to
00:04:59.720 a meme coin right and it's oh God yeah
00:05:03.080 go um yeah which was um which was bad
00:05:07.680 like I felt I felt that was I felt that
00:05:09.600 was one of those moments that probably
00:05:11.440 just set everything back several months
00:05:13.639 because it's like you know there was
00:05:15.080 there was a fair bit of mainstream media
00:05:17.560 interest um when Bitcoin hit 100K and um
00:05:22.440 but I felt that was kind of way uh Way
00:05:26.120 outpaced by um uh the amount of interest
00:05:28.880 about the hawk to mcoin rugging or you
00:05:31.919 know or everyone selling or whatever
00:05:33.919 whatever it actually was and you were
00:05:35.960 just like oh this is this is so bad for
00:05:39.400 the image this just reinforces a lot of
00:05:41.400 people's um a lot of people's
00:05:43.560 preconceptions about it so short answer
00:05:46.720 I think there I think we got a long way
00:05:47.960 to
00:05:49.759 go well that's always good to hear um
00:05:54.080 Rob any uh any anecdotes in your neck of
00:05:58.280 the woods seems like guys is thinking
00:06:01.039 you know there's there's some interest
00:06:02.680 but but still potentially a ways to go
00:06:05.479 now the only thing I did is the same
00:06:07.120 same story with guy and I'm I'm guessing
00:06:09.039 this is what everybody heard from their
00:06:11.080 friends and family hey Bitcoin went over
00:06:12.759 100k right that's crazy you did you
00:06:15.000 watch the game last night it's like it's
00:06:16.360 like that that Meme you know that you've
00:06:17.880 seen before and that's pretty much what
00:06:19.680 it was I thought I would get a little
00:06:21.120 more response for the Brad garlinghouse
00:06:23.360 6ut interview which we're going to talk
00:06:24.759 about in a bit but nobody told me about
00:06:26.800 that one and I and it just goes to show
00:06:28.599 you that sometime when when people talk
00:06:30.560 about Legacy Media is dead I think most
00:06:32.800 of those views for 60 Minutes were
00:06:34.400 probably the crypto people because I
00:06:35.680 don't hear anybody else really talking
00:06:37.120 about it so as far as like
00:06:40.560 anecdotal the only people that have come
00:06:42.919 back up to me is just like guy like hey
00:06:44.960 xrp is doing good hey cardano's doing
00:06:47.039 good hey this Dino coin from the last
00:06:49.080 cycle doing good and I think that's why
00:06:50.680 everything is pumping on the dino cycle
00:06:52.880 because the people are coming back and
00:06:54.160 going oh I remember what happened in
00:06:55.440 2020 2021 everything just took off I'll
00:06:58.000 just do that that again and then I'll
00:06:59.599 you know try to roundtrip my bags yet
00:07:01.919 again because people don't know how to
00:07:03.039 sell which is good for me I'm I'm happy
00:07:05.240 come on in I got plenty of bags to dump
00:07:07.039 on you but uh yeah it's the same thing
00:07:09.440 kind of going over and over again I
00:07:11.160 don't I don't think people are here yet
00:07:14.199 as far as like major
00:07:15.720 retail almost wonder if maybe that's why
00:07:18.400 some people have come back is because a
00:07:20.440 lot of the coins from last cycle started
00:07:23.280 going up a lot more recently um I I mean
00:07:26.919 I think it's what people know right if
00:07:28.800 if you you had a narrative and you're
00:07:30.560 like I don't know what hak Tua token
00:07:32.479 does I have no idea but I know that xrp
00:07:34.639 is for the banks right and it's supposed
00:07:36.080 to be crossb payments on demand
00:07:37.800 liquidity okay I'll get into that and
00:07:39.919 cardano was like the ethereum killer
00:07:41.560 from 20 from 2017 so maybe they just do
00:07:45.319 that stuff that's what I how I see it
00:07:49.080 well speaking of Brad Garling house I me
00:07:50.840 that's the basically the next thing I
00:07:52.360 want to talk about Rob so we'll go ahead
00:07:53.440 and start with you since you mentioned
00:07:55.080 it he recently went on 60 Minutes uh I
00:07:58.639 haven't actually had a to watch it yet I
00:08:00.639 have seen some you know people provide a
00:08:02.960 little bit of commentary on it but I'm
00:08:04.680 curious like did you watch it and what
00:08:07.199 are your thoughts about about how the
00:08:08.919 interview went H honestly uh I wasn't
00:08:12.639 going to watch it until you asked the
00:08:14.280 question and I'm like well I got to
00:08:15.720 watch it because what I saw was I mean I
00:08:18.280 saw the same response as you guys did
00:08:20.080 and I'm like well no one's really
00:08:21.280 watching 60 Minutes anymore so who
00:08:22.840 really cares but it was just it was just
00:08:25.000 the same thing over and over again uh
00:08:27.800 you know Brad Garling house was on and
00:08:29.840 if anyone wants to watch it's 13 minutes
00:08:32.279 probably the best parts are are Brad but
00:08:34.919 but the host pretty much kind of lays
00:08:36.640 into the the story as like crypto is
00:08:41.240 essentially trying to manipulate people
00:08:43.120 because they did a super pack and they
00:08:45.080 they raised all this money and they're
00:08:47.080 influencing uh these congressmen and
00:08:49.160 women and now they have like a vast
00:08:51.320 majority which is bad and evil that's
00:08:53.279 not really how it works this is America
00:08:55.880 we do what we want to do and we have a
00:08:57.519 freedom to do these things if we want to
00:08:58.880 put money in something to educate people
00:09:00.560 so much the better I believe the banks
00:09:02.399 did that not too long ago and it worked
00:09:03.880 out pretty well for them as Senator
00:09:05.360 Elizabeth Warren so when we have all
00:09:07.680 these things happening in the background
00:09:09.480 and they talk about that and and the the
00:09:12.480 problem with Legacy Media and I really
00:09:14.399 saw it in this one was that it's 13
00:09:16.399 minutes and you can't get a context of
00:09:18.760 what Brad is time to talk about and what
00:09:20.760 John Reed Stark who's a former SEC uh
00:09:23.440 chairperson no it was a he was part of
00:09:25.160 the SEC I think it was the internet
00:09:26.320 enforcement Division and where he talks
00:09:28.959 about how negative it is and and how
00:09:31.000 it's for elicit activity but he really
00:09:32.880 couldn't expand on it and then Brad came
00:09:34.959 in and he was talking about you know
00:09:37.839 giving counter points but again 13
00:09:39.440 minutes isn't enough so like this one
00:09:42.279 you can watch it but it really won't do
00:09:45.360 much for you and I don't really think
00:09:46.920 people are really looking at that as
00:09:48.920 like I'm gonna watch 60 Minutes for
00:09:50.519 investment advice but there was there
00:09:52.880 was yeah there's one funny quote here
00:09:56.560 which was from the SEC and they said G
00:09:59.560 ginzler was a professor at MIT when the
00:10:01.399 Trump Administration SEC brought charges
00:10:03.200 against Ripple for years the SEC
00:10:05.640 supported compliance with the Securities
00:10:07.360 laws any amount spent by the crypto
00:10:10.160 industry the Super PAC on legal defense
00:10:12.800 or influencing or influence pedaling
00:10:15.519 that's a good word that's a good
00:10:16.800 statement influence pedaling pales a
00:10:18.519 comparison to the savings lost by crypto
00:10:22.240 investors to frauds and failures and as
00:10:24.560 a
00:10:25.480 reminder Gary did a really crappy job at
00:10:28.440 that it only thing that I think he
00:10:30.440 really helped us from was staking with
00:10:32.600 Kraken so if anybody has any fingers to
00:10:35.079 point it's Gary ginzer as he met with
00:10:37.440 Sam bakman freed multiple times and he
00:10:39.360 couldn't even protect people from FTX
00:10:40.920 even though he knew the person in in
00:10:43.040 front of him so oh there was one last
00:10:46.959 thing and I would like everybody to know
00:10:48.760 this is that people will talk about how
00:10:51.120 like you're gonna hear this from your
00:10:53.600 whoever Bitcoin and crypto was used for
00:10:55.760 elicit activities and you can use all
00:10:57.680 these different things for like drug
00:10:59.279 smuggling and it's used with the cartels
00:11:00.560 and whatever else there is this study
00:11:03.839 and it was commissioned part of it by
00:11:06.040 Michael moral he is the former acting
00:11:08.800 direct director deputy director and
00:11:11.320 director of the CIA this is in 2021 and
00:11:14.800 his findings were this which is why this
00:11:16.240 is always makes me mad when I hear
00:11:17.639 people like John Reed Stark start to rep
00:11:19.720 off some things about elicit activity
00:11:21.200 and he says very very simply the broad
00:11:24.200 generalization about the use of Bitcoin
00:11:25.639 listen Finance are significantly
00:11:27.320 overstated the blockchain ler in which
00:11:29.720 Bitcoin transactions are recorded is an
00:11:31.880 underutilized forensic tool that can be
00:11:33.839 used more widely by law enforcement
00:11:36.000 you're welcome to read it I'll link it
00:11:37.560 in a show I'll do later but it just it
00:11:41.519 angers me that those those types of
00:11:43.200 pieces are out but I mean what can you
00:11:44.880 get in 13 minutes that was my that was
00:11:46.920 my assumption of what I saw I could be
00:11:49.399 wrong no know I mean it's good to hear
00:11:51.440 your hear your opinion guy did you have
00:11:53.680 any uh any different
00:11:56.880 takes well I watched um I so I sort of I
00:12:00.160 I kind of was able to find a a sort of
00:12:02.120 highlights package if you like of the of
00:12:04.200 the um the interview of the program I
00:12:06.079 should say and I I thought that there's
00:12:08.760 some interesting things stuck out to me
00:12:10.480 I I didn't realize that the um the
00:12:13.519 crypto industry supported 29
00:12:17.480 Republicans in the in in the election
00:12:20.240 that that You' just had 29 Republicans
00:12:22.839 and 33 Democrats so you know the idea
00:12:26.639 that uh this is a this is a purely sort
00:12:29.040 of you know right-wing focused industry
00:12:31.480 is completely wrong and um 85% of those
00:12:34.560 candidates won so this is this is
00:12:36.959 something that's that's bipartisan it
00:12:39.040 doesn't you know you know they're
00:12:41.199 supporting more Democrats than
00:12:42.519 Republicans I thought that was really
00:12:43.880 interesting um and a third of all direct
00:12:47.360 contributions to superpacs came from
00:12:49.240 crypto companies which I thought was
00:12:51.040 very interesting as well um and you know
00:12:53.600 it just shows it just shows the power of
00:12:55.560 this industry and like that I I think
00:12:58.639 it's really I think it's really sort of
00:13:00.639 Insidious the way that they the way that
00:13:02.519 the program and you know plenty of
00:13:04.120 others are sort of painting this as as
00:13:06.760 the crypto industry you know being this
00:13:09.120 sort of uniquely um manipulative entity
00:13:13.800 you know that that that's that's trying
00:13:15.240 to buy the election it's like you know
00:13:17.600 this is this is American politics like
00:13:19.399 lobbying is is huge like every industry
00:13:22.600 lobbies and the crypto industry is just
00:13:25.560 better organized and better funded than
00:13:27.760 a lot of others and and was remarkably
00:13:30.639 effective and I think okay they can
00:13:32.639 paint that as a negative um and
00:13:34.839 obviously we're we're kind of biased but
00:13:36.519 I think that's a I think that's a huge
00:13:37.920 positive and I think that reflects very
00:13:40.120 well on the industry itself um that and
00:13:43.120 that it's prepared to it's prepared to
00:13:45.279 fight to try and get you know to try and
00:13:47.160 get these these um Pro crypto candidates
00:13:50.399 in and to try and get this legislation
00:13:53.279 that we're crying out for and that was
00:13:54.480 something that Brad I think did a good
00:13:55.959 job of saying he's like we're not we're
00:13:57.560 not asking to be exemp
00:13:59.639 we're not asking for exemption um which
00:14:02.680 I think was kind of what the you know
00:14:04.959 the program sort of seemed to be
00:14:06.279 implying I think at points it's like oh
00:14:08.199 crypto you know they they want they want
00:14:10.399 things all their own way it's like no we
00:14:12.160 just want regulation like you know this
00:14:15.000 we we're not asking for special
00:14:16.759 treatment so I thought that was really
00:14:18.160 interesting um and what else stuck out
00:14:21.519 to me um I think yeah I think sorry
00:14:26.240 sorry there was this one comment where
00:14:28.800 Brad said uh because they talked about
00:14:31.759 SPF and they said well you know that
00:14:33.320 guy's the biggest scammer in crypto and
00:14:35.440 that's that registers crypto he said
00:14:38.120 well Bernie made off was essentially a
00:14:40.639 scamster but it doesn't mean the all
00:14:41.959 entire equities and hedge funds are are
00:14:43.800 bad
00:14:44.839 people yeah that was this is yeah this
00:14:48.120 is the this is this is the way it see
00:14:50.240 it's always been like if if there's a
00:14:52.120 bad actor in crypto then that then that
00:14:55.199 reflects back on all of crypto whereas
00:14:57.639 out in the trafi world it's just them
00:14:59.639 you know it's it's not the it's not the
00:15:01.320 system I guess I guess it's the same
00:15:02.720 sort of thing it's like well um much
00:15:05.519 more illicit Financial activity H takes
00:15:08.040 place with cash which is way more
00:15:10.480 untraceable than than Bitcoin and you
00:15:12.880 know most cryptocurrencies but you don't
00:15:15.079 no one talks about banning cash do they
00:15:17.320 it's sort of you know it's kind of one
00:15:18.720 rule one rule for trafi and a completely
00:15:21.680 different set of rules for crypto
00:15:23.040 apparently and that I mean that's that's
00:15:25.199 something that we've we've kind of dealt
00:15:26.839 with for for years now so it was nothing
00:15:28.600 new um I thought the whole from what I
00:15:31.480 saw of the program I thought it was kind
00:15:33.279 of funny you know that I I felt the the
00:15:35.519 woman conducting the interview and just
00:15:37.160 sort of the presenters in general just
00:15:38.959 look they look so disgusted to be
00:15:41.120 talking about crypto you know they
00:15:42.600 really sort of yeah it l like they
00:15:45.199 looked like they caught a whiff of
00:15:46.759 something disgusting whenever they were
00:15:48.279 talking about it I thought that was
00:15:49.480 funny but something that another thing
00:15:51.480 that kind of stuck out to me about it
00:15:52.959 was I'd forgotten or maybe I wasn't
00:15:55.079 aware to start with just how shuny and
00:15:59.120 rubbish us like broadcast TV is you guys
00:16:03.519 really like you when it comes to like
00:16:05.319 making shows or like making films and
00:16:07.959 stuff you guys you know knock it out of
00:16:10.279 the park but like actual kind of
00:16:11.959 broadcast current affairs TV it was it
00:16:15.680 was comically bad I was like was this
00:16:17.800 made in
00:16:19.319 1999 you know that sort of ticking
00:16:21.639 stopwatch thing I was like wow this is
00:16:24.959 like this is real Third World stuff and
00:16:27.560 like you know I know this is going to
00:16:28.959 know this is going to annoy annoy a lot
00:16:30.319 of Americans in the comments you're just
00:16:31.680 going to be like oh well some some
00:16:33.079 briting things he did but like actually
00:16:35.800 um you know you guys should take a leaf
00:16:37.839 out of you should take a leaf out of
00:16:39.440 British TV like we may we may produce a
00:16:41.560 lot of crap but we do it well um but I
00:16:44.440 was just like wow this is this is so
00:16:47.160 dated um but it but it kind of it kind
00:16:50.920 of got me thinking as well you know
00:16:52.319 maybe this is a sort of comment on on
00:16:54.040 sort of mainstream you know mainstream
00:16:56.399 media in general these guys are so of
00:16:59.199 touch and I think I I saw a comment I
00:17:02.000 watched this I watched this highlights
00:17:03.399 package on on YouTube and I saw a
00:17:04.880 comment it's like Brad shouldn't have
00:17:06.679 done Brad shouldn't have been wasting
00:17:08.079 his time with this he should have gone
00:17:09.319 on Joe Rogan and I thought actually yeah
00:17:12.400 yeah you know this is my I I I think
00:17:15.000 it's kind of a waste of time I think I
00:17:16.839 think shows like 60 minutes and you know
00:17:19.439 so much of this mainstream Media stuff
00:17:21.119 and that you know no political bias here
00:17:22.919 whether it's on the right or on the left
00:17:24.359 I think it's all just you know it's all
00:17:26.199 just broadcasting to its own Echo
00:17:27.880 Chambers and I think a lot of people are
00:17:30.080 disengaged with it um it looks like it's
00:17:33.280 from the late 20th century a lot of it
00:17:36.000 um and I think it just highlights the
00:17:38.240 fact that the media landscape is
00:17:39.679 changing so much people are getting
00:17:41.240 their information from YouTube I people
00:17:44.280 are getting their information from
00:17:45.840 Twitter and Tik Tok but like you know
00:17:48.039 the um but I think the rise of the
00:17:49.520 podcasters and this was talked about a
00:17:51.480 lot in the in in context of the election
00:17:53.799 wasn't it you know the The Joe Rogan
00:17:55.760 talking to uh to Donald Trump was was
00:17:58.440 huge and I think it it just reinforced
00:18:01.240 to me that kind of Legacy Media is is
00:18:04.320 dying and um you know it needs to it
00:18:07.400 needs to get with the program thank God
00:18:10.840 I had a couple of thoughts because uh
00:18:12.320 you mentioned the uh you
00:18:14.960 know Bitcoin and and sort of a lot of
00:18:18.080 the scams that occur in crypto but the
00:18:20.120 thing is is and as you mentioned right I
00:18:22.200 mean I think Robin was talking about
00:18:23.240 this too like at least it's traceable I
00:18:25.039 mean you know and think about think
00:18:26.960 about every uh scammer
00:18:29.720 that launches a meme coin rug pool thing
00:18:32.720 and then rugs and we just had the one
00:18:34.159 last week you know um and then you know
00:18:37.559 within minutes you have tons of onchain
00:18:41.240 detectives figuring out what actually
00:18:43.000 happened um so uh it seems like I think
00:18:46.880 some people forget you know the people
00:18:48.400 that sort of commit these these um that
00:18:52.080 do these things I I think that they kind
00:18:53.600 of forget that like what they what they
00:18:55.240 do is actually traceable the other thing
00:18:57.360 I wanted to mention is that if you
00:18:58.799 didn't know guy was from the UK you do
00:19:01.360 now because he did use the word rubbish
00:19:03.240 I don't know if anyone else yeah that
00:19:05.720 yeah that wasn't just a really good
00:19:07.000 accent that he was trying to pull off
00:19:08.480 he's he's
00:19:10.799 from does that have to be translated for
00:19:13.200 you guys have that word at all I don't
00:19:16.960 think it's even part of the L yeah I
00:19:18.440 don't I don't think anyone anyone says
00:19:19.880 it over here nobody says it over here
00:19:22.120 but but I I know where you're from
00:19:23.720 because I hear I hear rubbish I heard
00:19:25.280 smart money kmto said it yesterday and
00:19:26.960 I'm like oh okay UK there it is yeah
00:19:30.799 yeah oh it's a great word it's a great
00:19:32.400 word trash no no it's it's an up it's no
00:19:36.840 good you go back to rubbish be much
00:19:38.559 better actually speaking of speaking of
00:19:40.600 scams I did see a comment earlier um
00:19:42.720 from Ronnie um can I just clear this up
00:19:44.760 for people watching guy um it says for
00:19:46.760 guy is the CBR drop legit got an email
00:19:50.200 guess what Ronnie no it's not we're not
00:19:52.960 launch we are not launching a token if
00:19:54.919 you've got an email about a coin Bureau
00:19:56.720 token it's a scam please don't do
00:19:59.600 anything this stuff happens so annoying
00:20:02.360 it's it's not legit um yeah so don't
00:20:06.679 click on anything hey here okay here's a
00:20:08.720 quick question talking about uh if you
00:20:11.080 know people coming back in how many scam
00:20:13.280 emails do you guys get a week from your
00:20:15.960 exchange whether that be coinbase or
00:20:18.120 binance or whatever you're using how
00:20:19.360 many scam emails do you get because
00:20:21.559 right now I'm counting seven so far this
00:20:24.440 week
00:20:29.600 a
00:20:31.440 few yeah I think I have like 49,000 unre
00:20:34.919 emails so I couldn't tell
00:20:37.360 you there you
00:20:39.760 go I have been getting a lot of uh I
00:20:42.640 have been getting a lot of people like
00:20:43.799 reaching out to like promote their um
00:20:47.360 like their meme coin that kind of stuff
00:20:49.480 I I have seen those
00:20:52.559 uh but I just know I always just ignore
00:20:56.200 them or I tell them I'm not interested
00:20:58.760 no it's pretty nice just ignore yeah
00:21:01.440 usually just I think a lot of it is is
00:21:03.120 being AI generated now I get tons of
00:21:05.600 emails asking about like content on
00:21:07.919 coin.com and it's so like I was like
00:21:11.279 where where have all these people popped
00:21:12.760 up from but I think it's all just
00:21:15.080 AI you know that's that's another use
00:21:18.720 case for it right
00:21:20.279 there scary well the uh the next thing
00:21:25.000 um Eric Trump recently said and I quote
00:21:29.200 he says I'm confident that Bitcoin is
00:21:30.919 going to hit 1
00:21:32.200 million what do you guys think do you
00:21:34.159 guys agree with this assessment or
00:21:36.279 disagree
00:21:37.559 Rob if we keep printing money then yes
00:21:42.840 that's pretty much it I'm what last
00:21:44.840 thing I'll say is I'm glad that people
00:21:46.799 in the administration are so bullish on
00:21:48.400 bitcoin I don't think the Biden
00:21:49.640 Administration was nearly that bullish
00:21:51.360 so that's good but yeah why
00:21:54.200 not guy what do you
00:21:57.279 think he
00:21:59.240 and and and I think he said um that it
00:22:01.279 was going to hit 1 million during his
00:22:03.520 during his dad's presidency So within
00:22:06.360 the next four years um right yeah within
00:22:08.640 the next four years yeah I I yeah I
00:22:11.720 agree with Rob I think yeah if if the
00:22:13.480 money print if the money printing goes
00:22:15.039 on and the dollar continues to continues
00:22:17.480 to devalue then it's probably a question
00:22:19.480 of just you know when not if Bitcoin
00:22:22.559 hits a million I I kind of think maybe
00:22:25.720 if we if we start seeing nation state
00:22:27.679 accumulation I know we've talked about
00:22:29.200 this um idea of a strategic reserve a
00:22:31.279 few times because it's kind of very much
00:22:33.720 it's very much a meme in crypto at the
00:22:35.200 moment isn't it but if if the US does
00:22:38.159 start accumulating if other countries
00:22:40.120 start accumulating um then that I I I
00:22:44.480 think I think that would you know that
00:22:46.120 would accelerate that charge towards a
00:22:48.159 million like I say I think maybe within
00:22:49.799 the next four years is is is a little
00:22:51.520 bit ambitious um but certainly not
00:22:54.320 impossible which I which just in itself
00:22:57.080 is kind of crazy and what's interesting
00:22:59.440 is I think if Bitcoin was to hit 1
00:23:01.520 million that would kind of would kind of
00:23:04.279 be quite neat because that would give it
00:23:05.840 a market cap roughly On a par with gold
00:23:09.080 um and obviously you know bit Bitcoin
00:23:10.799 digital gold Etc um so yeah yeah I I I
00:23:16.520 think maybe maybe project a little
00:23:18.760 further out maybe sort of by 2030 and
00:23:21.000 stuff that could be uh that could be
00:23:23.080 more realistic I don't think in in four
00:23:25.799 years yeah one of those things
00:23:28.960 seems like one of those things where
00:23:30.039 people like overestimate the short term
00:23:32.400 and underestimate the long term um
00:23:35.240 exactly probably something like that uh
00:23:38.039 next question guy we'll start with you
00:23:39.760 on this one and by the way guys if you
00:23:41.039 have questions feel free to ask them
00:23:43.400 because we only got a couple more
00:23:44.520 questions here we like to get some
00:23:45.640 audience questions but
00:23:48.159 um CZ recently said that he tweeted this
00:23:53.240 out he says I'm not against memes but
00:23:56.760 meme coins are getting a little weird
00:23:59.120 now let's build real applications using
00:24:01.880 blockchain I'm kind of curious it seem
00:24:04.960 to me it seems like the meme coin
00:24:07.400 discussion this cycle has been a little
00:24:09.640 bit more you know elevated than it was
00:24:12.799 in Prior Cycles they've always kind of
00:24:14.240 been there but it seems like this cycle
00:24:16.400 we've especially seen it um I mean
00:24:19.960 there's even a lot of people talking
00:24:20.960 about like meme coins super cycles and
00:24:23.080 all that sort of stuff but I'm curious I
00:24:24.919 mean do you guys think that the industry
00:24:26.799 has veered toward too much uh into the
00:24:30.320 meme coin Direction and not enough in
00:24:34.679 like real world utility Direction I mean
00:24:37.520 I'm not saying that no coins offer
00:24:39.840 utility but I just I'm curious guy what
00:24:42.159 do you what do you think I mean h have
00:24:43.600 has the industry gone too far in in that
00:24:46.720 direction and we'll have to reverse
00:24:47.919 course or do you think it's just um kind
00:24:50.559 of the same as always and and it's uh
00:24:54.080 you know it seems like it's loud but
00:24:56.000 maybe it's not as representative of the
00:24:57.760 industry as I
00:24:59.480 think yeah this is an interesting one
00:25:02.440 because we I was kind of thinking about
00:25:04.200 this for for a recent video um you know
00:25:07.159 because the it it feels now that memes
00:25:09.120 have been meme coins have been around
00:25:10.320 for such a long time and but actually it
00:25:12.240 was a very slow sort of start you know
00:25:13.919 you had you heard Dogecoin come along
00:25:15.720 quite early and then sort of ship came
00:25:17.960 along and it was oh you know the
00:25:19.279 Dogecoin killer or whatever and then I
00:25:21.480 think the following year you had like
00:25:24.279 flaky or something like that and then
00:25:26.120 Pepe in 2023 but you know it if it was
00:25:29.399 actually quite a slow process you're
00:25:31.240 basically kind of getting one big meme
00:25:33.200 coin a year and then obviously it all
00:25:36.039 changed in 2024 and that is you know
00:25:38.520 that is because of you know pump. fun
00:25:40.679 and has suddenly suddenly made it um you
00:25:43.360 know possible for anyone to to create
00:25:45.320 one of these things and I kind of think
00:25:48.080 I I don't think necessarily the industry
00:25:50.840 itself as in uh as in the builders
00:25:55.399 developers companies um you know trying
00:25:58.320 trying to do stuff I I I wouldn't
00:25:59.760 necessarily say that perhaps that cohort
00:26:02.480 of people have gone too far in the mcoin
00:26:05.399 direction but I certainly think you know
00:26:07.799 because of pump. fun a lot of Market
00:26:11.200 participants certainly have but I I kind
00:26:14.880 of feel that's a reflection that's a
00:26:17.080 reflection of society um you know that
00:26:19.559 that's a reflection of this of of this
00:26:21.279 sense of financial nihilism that a lot
00:26:23.640 of people feel um the kind of
00:26:25.880 desperation to get ahead and you know
00:26:28.799 being prepared to sort of take these big
00:26:31.600 kind of YOLO punts on these you know
00:26:34.080 Meme coins that will probably go to zero
00:26:35.960 but are still kind of better odds than a
00:26:38.520 lottery ticket um because it goes back
00:26:40.520 to I think it was it was Travis cing who
00:26:42.960 who um who who started talking about
00:26:45.000 this earlier this year and sort of
00:26:46.399 highlighting the fact that you know your
00:26:49.000 average you know for your average
00:26:50.520 American say you know who's trying to
00:26:52.200 get ahead $500 isn't going to make a
00:26:55.039 huge amount of difference one way or the
00:26:57.559 other so why not YOLO it all on a mcoin
00:27:02.679 that could that could change their life
00:27:04.440 because if they keep hold of the $500
00:27:06.320 it's not necessarily going to make any
00:27:07.600 difference so I think it's kind of I I I
00:27:10.320 think the whole meme thing is sort of
00:27:12.039 feeding on the the kind of you know
00:27:15.640 wider Society the fact that the
00:27:17.320 financial system is so is so broken and
00:27:20.559 I think seems so rigged against
00:27:23.600 especially younger people which is
00:27:25.000 obviously kind of crypto's core audience
00:27:27.080 I think there are a lot of people out
00:27:28.440 there who feel very disenfranchised very
00:27:31.200 disconnected um and don't feel like
00:27:33.440 they're going to they have any other
00:27:35.120 means of getting ahead and I think mem
00:27:37.000 coins have filled that Gap um and I
00:27:40.399 don't I I I don't think that's that's
00:27:43.360 necessarily a good thing or or
00:27:45.799 necessarily a bad thing I think it's
00:27:47.440 just it's kind of the market providing
00:27:50.399 what people what people want um but yeah
00:27:53.960 I think the industry itself um there's
00:27:56.000 been I think there's been sort of quite
00:27:57.640 a lot of hand ring about it hasn't there
00:27:59.640 and it's been like is this is this all
00:28:01.799 we've got you it's like well yeah I
00:28:04.960 think because but it just goes to show
00:28:06.880 how powerful and and the importance in
00:28:09.880 crypto of of killer apps it underlines
00:28:12.919 this idea that crypto is going to take
00:28:14.480 off once it gets killer apps and pump.
00:28:17.000 fun is exactly that like it you know it
00:28:19.519 we didn't it was the app we didn't know
00:28:21.559 we we needed or we didn't know we wanted
00:28:24.640 um but it it I think it underlines just
00:28:27.000 when you when these when these apps get
00:28:29.720 created when these thing when you give
00:28:31.360 people what they want then cry crypto so
00:28:35.519 much more becomes possible and kind of
00:28:37.360 things explode a bit and this time it
00:28:39.240 was meme coins let's hope as we get
00:28:41.519 further into the cycle there's a bit
00:28:43.360 more utility you know we get apps that
00:28:45.080 offer sort of stuff that's a bit more
00:28:47.080 useful but like you know pump. fun it's
00:28:50.720 crazy and it's making so much damn money
00:28:53.399 it's it's extraordinary so I mean that's
00:28:56.200 been kind of thrilling thrilling to see
00:28:59.640 perhaps it just uh helps kind of
00:29:01.880 showcase just how much excess liquidity
00:29:03.919 there is slushing around for you know
00:29:06.640 that to even be a thing I mean you have
00:29:08.080 to imagine that during really bad times
00:29:11.440 that something like that probably
00:29:12.440 wouldn't be as successful but with all
00:29:15.120 the uh liquidity just kind of sashing
00:29:16.880 around especially since the pandemic
00:29:18.840 it's given you know the the ability of
00:29:21.000 some of these things to really take off
00:29:23.440 um that's right Rob what are your
00:29:25.840 thoughts I mean what are your thoughts
00:29:27.159 about the uh the mcoin
00:29:29.880 craze I was just I was just thinking
00:29:32.120 about what guy said about utility I want
00:29:34.360 everybody to to correct me in the
00:29:36.519 comment section but if if all crypto and
00:29:39.559 digital assets went away
00:29:42.000 today besides Bitcoin would your life go
00:29:45.320 on would do you need anything in the
00:29:48.080 digital asset space that is Paramount
00:29:50.360 that you cannot live without and don't
00:29:52.640 tell me that you need pump. fun for meme
00:29:54.880 coins I'm just curious because like when
00:29:57.240 we when we compare like the crypto
00:29:59.039 Market digital asset I I get Bitcoin
00:30:01.519 obviously and I'm a fan of altcoins but
00:30:05.399 if you take them away
00:30:06.960 today like what is what right now is a
00:30:09.960 difference for you and then um another
00:30:13.880 question would be like when we compare
00:30:17.799 the internet to crypto Nal assets we're
00:30:21.480 comparing like a real utility there that
00:30:24.360 is the internet if you took away the
00:30:26.279 internet today how would your life
00:30:27.480 change
00:30:28.519 if you took away fcoin today how would
00:30:31.039 your life change so I think like some of
00:30:33.799 these these meme coins I mean it's it's
00:30:36.240 gambling nothing wrong with that I used
00:30:37.559 to live in Vegas it's a great place but
00:30:39.600 it is it is what it is and I and um just
00:30:43.360 like what guy said people who are
00:30:44.720 younger They Don't Really they don't
00:30:46.519 think there's any other option for them
00:30:48.480 because they weren't taught about
00:30:49.919 investing in school they weren't taught
00:30:52.679 about risk assessments they weren't
00:30:54.320 taught about you know long-term trends
00:30:57.000 so they look at this and go I want do
00:30:58.360 that and I think that's that's a huge
00:31:00.279 Pitfall and I I saw like even Haw Tua I
00:31:02.559 saw somebody who said that they put
00:31:04.120 their life savings in HW Tua how bad our
00:31:07.000 education system where you put your
00:31:08.519 entire life savings into a mem coin from
00:31:10.919 a person that just got famous for
00:31:12.639 spitting on whatever so like I just I
00:31:17.600 meem coins will be around for a while
00:31:19.519 but but the question I I have is like
00:31:21.519 when is like the real utility going to
00:31:23.559 really come in and that's what I think
00:31:25.480 about and of course in the comments I'm
00:31:27.279 not going to save my thoughts of this
00:31:28.679 just tell me where the utility is and
00:31:30.559 we'll go from
00:31:32.519 there yeah know I mean it's it's
00:31:34.320 definitely an interesting thing I think
00:31:35.480 that's the sort of the thing like is the
00:31:37.399 uh I guess some people view it as like
00:31:39.320 the meme coins some people would say
00:31:41.279 like the mem coins kind of are the fun
00:31:43.679 the utility aspect of it but is it you
00:31:46.840 know does it actually provide I don't
00:31:48.360 know it's hard to we'll see we'll see in
00:31:50.320 a few years um I'm curious what are you
00:31:53.559 guys thoughts on 2025 I mean you know
00:31:55.679 Bitcoin has essentially been going up up
00:31:58.559 for couple years now obviously Bitcoin
00:32:02.159 dominance is going up for a few years
00:32:03.919 but it's recently taken a big hit do do
00:32:06.440 you guys sort of think there's going to
00:32:07.960 be some narrative
00:32:09.679 shifts in um in 2025 like what do you
00:32:13.200 what do you what are your general
00:32:14.480 expectations for 2025
00:32:17.080 Rob uh I well I mean thankfully I've
00:32:22.000 been since 2017 I've never seen this
00:32:24.080 much this much bullishness and this much
00:32:26.679 Tailwinds before like we talked about
00:32:28.760 with the government everything I expect
00:32:30.519 2025 to be massive and I think we've
00:32:32.880 talked about this many a time how this
00:32:34.720 cycle doesn't feel like last cycle it
00:32:36.240 feels like the cycle like 2016 and 17 18
00:32:39.919 so I see some pretty big return on
00:32:42.639 investments and I see things going much
00:32:45.039 much farther if we get regulation
00:32:46.639 Clarity that's I that was always my big
00:32:48.880 thing just tell us what we need to do
00:32:50.360 and we'll move forward so I think 2025
00:32:52.399 will be good the question I have and I
00:32:55.120 heard you guys we were talking about
00:32:56.279 this before is you know wedes the next
00:32:58.159 big pullback I think we're we should
00:33:00.200 expect to see one we already had a
00:33:01.919 little bit but we're going to see some
00:33:03.760 big pullbacks coming up I think uh
00:33:06.320 relatively
00:33:07.320 soon this person says investing in meme
00:33:09.799 coins classy if you're rich trash
00:33:13.440 trash this is abolutely 100%
00:33:17.480 true guy what are your thoughts
00:33:21.880 for um yeah I yeah I I agree with Rob
00:33:25.080 that the the Tailwinds um you know
00:33:27.840 especially now that the US has has
00:33:29.440 flipped Pro crypto are are massive and
00:33:32.760 there's there's so much potential I
00:33:34.399 think to be unlocked next year um so I
00:33:37.519 think yeah I mean you know one of the I
00:33:39.760 think one of the easier sort of
00:33:41.360 predictions to make for 2025 is that uh
00:33:44.279 we'll see more we'll see some regulation
00:33:46.639 coming out of the United States and I
00:33:48.159 think that will be I think that will be
00:33:50.039 huge um and that will that will I hope
00:33:53.880 change a lot of people's perception of
00:33:56.120 crypto and help and help give it the
00:33:58.120 legitimacy that it doesn't always
00:34:01.279 deserve but you know not every sector of
00:34:02.919 it deserves but you know it will will
00:34:05.440 help I I I think we'll help projects
00:34:08.119 that are offering utility will give them
00:34:10.119 a better environment to build in so I
00:34:11.599 think that's one thing we can look
00:34:12.599 forward to um I think something I think
00:34:15.320 an important thing for 2025 is that the
00:34:17.960 the top will catch us all unawares um
00:34:21.679 and I think you know as as we've seen in
00:34:24.520 as we've seen in previous Cycles you
00:34:26.399 know people will people will bag hold
00:34:28.800 people will uh you know hold it round
00:34:31.280 trip a lot of their gains and things
00:34:32.719 like that and I think that so that
00:34:34.320 underlines the fact that you know you
00:34:35.918 have to have as we've said before you
00:34:37.879 have to have a plan and stick to it but
00:34:39.719 I think it could it could come it could
00:34:42.399 come a lot earlier or indeed a lot later
00:34:45.199 than than any of us suspect so I think
00:34:47.480 it's it's going to be really important
00:34:49.280 to be sort of logged in and switched on
00:34:52.280 I think that's going to that's going to
00:34:53.639 make a lot of difference and then I
00:34:55.440 think um the one of the things I've been
00:34:58.599 just obsessing about recently is AI and
00:35:01.280 AI agents and I think that's going to I
00:35:03.560 I think next year could see a huge
00:35:07.560 shakeup um from AI I think uh what one
00:35:11.920 of the things I'm really excited about
00:35:13.480 is this idea of AI agents being able to
00:35:16.760 abstract away a lot of the complexities
00:35:18.920 of dealing with I think I might have
00:35:20.079 mentioned this last week but a lot of
00:35:21.320 the complexities of interacting with
00:35:23.200 crypto and blockchains um that next year
00:35:26.640 may be a little bit ear for that to you
00:35:28.680 know for that to really be felt but I
00:35:30.359 think maybe by the by this time next
00:35:33.280 year uh I think it it will be so much
00:35:37.400 easier for your average person to
00:35:40.040 interact with crypto and they may not
00:35:41.839 have to really give it all that much
00:35:43.520 mind share and I think that will that
00:35:45.359 will mean that things like defi become
00:35:47.760 much more entrenched and it opens up I
00:35:50.440 think it just opens up so many
00:35:51.839 opportunities so I'm I'm excited about
00:35:54.040 that I just think there's yeah it it's
00:35:56.920 it's rare that that have felt sort of as
00:35:59.040 as as excited about a coming year which
00:36:02.079 probably suggests the some a Black Swan
00:36:04.800 just about to about to land so I'll cave
00:36:07.680 at that but um yeah there's there's I
00:36:09.880 think there's a ton of stuff to be
00:36:11.119 excited about well yeah you know you're
00:36:13.359 you're you're probably right that the
00:36:14.839 the top will catch a lot of people off
00:36:17.280 guard and you know we we've actually
00:36:18.920 talked a little bit about sort of the
00:36:20.520 cycle theories before um you know
00:36:23.440 normally Bitcoin tops Q4 of the post
00:36:26.560 having year which essentially would be
00:36:27.839 almost a year from now obviously there
00:36:30.560 there are discussions that we've had
00:36:32.720 before and and that especially other
00:36:34.319 people have had about like a left
00:36:35.560 translated cycle um you know could you
00:36:37.599 see something like that and it kind of
00:36:39.599 reminds me of of something that Rob
00:36:41.319 always says and it's just like you know
00:36:42.720 just take profits you know you make
00:36:44.160 money take profits no one knows what the
00:36:46.560 future holds um you know you might there
00:36:50.160 there's a famous quote that people say
00:36:51.880 about you know it's like um you know you
00:36:55.160 first of all you won't go broke taking
00:36:56.400 profits obviously but
00:36:58.280 um the way you get rich is to sell too
00:37:00.440 early it's better to sell it's better to
00:37:03.119 I think Rob has said that a few times um
00:37:06.240 you know it's better to sell to early
00:37:08.760 than to basically hold on and and and
00:37:10.720 wait for it to drop you know 95% some of
00:37:13.800 those alts can drop a lot in in bare
00:37:17.040 Market years yeah it's true it was it
00:37:19.800 was a quote from Baron Rothchild and he
00:37:21.440 said I made all my money by uh never
00:37:24.119 buying the bottom and selling way too
00:37:25.880 soon and it makes sense and like a lot
00:37:27.440 of lot of people are telling me that or
00:37:29.119 some people telling me like hey you know
00:37:31.400 if we take a look from you know the
00:37:33.079 having to to the to the peak point we're
00:37:34.920 looking at a year that's April 20th 2025
00:37:38.319 and I said well remember we did go up we
00:37:40.319 had a double top you know April 2021
00:37:42.720 November 2021 they said who cares if I
00:37:45.200 just get close to the first stop and I
00:37:47.640 and I sell and it goes down great if it
00:37:49.920 keeps going up I mean hey I still got a
00:37:52.040 pretty big profits but I guess just
00:37:54.400 whatever people want to do well I do
00:37:56.760 feel like a lot of people people are are
00:37:58.200 somewhat obsessed with like timing the
00:37:59.680 bottom and timing the top but I think a
00:38:01.440 most the money is made sort of in the
00:38:03.000 middle of the trends you know like not
00:38:05.200 because I don't I mean no one can really
00:38:06.440 time things perfectly let's get to some
00:38:08.400 of the questions um so one question is
00:38:10.960 let's suppose you are able to take
00:38:13.240 profits before the uh the actual bare
00:38:16.280 Market begins um where would you put it
00:38:18.839 like where would you put your your gains
00:38:21.000 uh let's say in in 2026 uh is there is
00:38:24.920 there any asset class that you would
00:38:26.880 look to sort of Park your your your
00:38:29.040 money um during that year for those who
00:38:31.920 are new I mean
00:38:33.960 historically uh midterm years are bare
00:38:36.400 markets for cryptos that be 2014 2018
00:38:38.960 2022 so that's why they're saying 2026
00:38:41.440 so either of you guys have any ideas as
00:38:43.640 to where you would park your money for
00:38:45.480 that
00:38:46.240 year yes I would put it on I no I was
00:38:51.119 gonna say I was put all meme coins it's
00:38:52.480 Dum but I what I would do is I would pay
00:38:53.920 off this like I I took some profits a
00:38:56.119 couple months ago for an apartment
00:38:57.440 Department complex so I'll be I finally
00:38:59.960 pay off the rest of that and then just
00:39:02.280 uh use the funds to accumulate uh in the
00:39:05.280 bare market and then start to use the
00:39:06.920 risk bands which I find in this great
00:39:09.040 website you know the cryptoverse and
00:39:11.200 just pretty much play that again and for
00:39:13.720 the next one I know people and then
00:39:16.520 people will say ah but we're we're still
00:39:18.800 too late and you know we're not early
00:39:21.200 there's two things first of all Michael
00:39:22.680 sailor even said that uh Bitcoin at
00:39:25.079 100,000 is a 90% discount and that would
00:39:28.200 be up to a million and then the second
00:39:30.359 thing is like if you think that we're
00:39:31.760 not early or if you think that it's
00:39:33.440 early or not early just take a look at
00:39:35.319 that Microsoft vote where
00:39:38.079 0.55% of all the board members approved
00:39:41.079 for Bitcoin and the 99 point four4 five
00:39:45.359 said no way not a chance in hell so for
00:39:48.040 me like I just think we're gonna have
00:39:49.800 we're gonna keep having these Cycles
00:39:51.720 I'll take those profits I'll stick them
00:39:53.960 on just to because cash is King at some
00:39:56.079 point for dry powder
00:39:57.839 and I'll pay off the rest of my other
00:39:59.960 Investments which would be just this
00:40:01.680 last this last
00:40:04.720 complex sounds like a good plan guy any
00:40:07.560 other any any spot you would put your
00:40:09.400 money in uh
00:40:11.319 2026 I do I do like the idea of of of
00:40:14.440 real estate um I mean just because I
00:40:17.119 think it's you know well it's great to
00:40:18.599 have it's somewhere to somewhere to live
00:40:20.880 um and you can you know you can you can
00:40:23.000 get a you can get an income off that or
00:40:24.640 even just saving on rent so that would
00:40:26.400 be somewhere where i' look to parks and
00:40:28.040 profits but I mean I kind of think you
00:40:29.560 know by about by the time we're sort
00:40:32.440 2026 presumably mid bare Market that's
00:40:36.079 the time I'm probably going to be
00:40:38.000 looking and trying to figure out what
00:40:40.040 the next narratives are going to be you
00:40:42.920 know the narratives of the next cycle um
00:40:46.720 and looking to you know looking to
00:40:48.480 allocate into that because I I've seen a
00:40:50.200 few people in the comments saying you
00:40:51.520 know the the money is made in the in the
00:40:53.920 in the deep dark of the of the bare
00:40:55.880 market and they're right you know um so
00:40:58.720 I I be you know I I'm not going to I'm
00:41:00.599 not going to put all my all my capital
00:41:03.319 in in at that point but I'd certainly be
00:41:05.079 looking to try and identify some early
00:41:07.319 narratives um things like I mean
00:41:09.400 something that I'm I think is going to
00:41:11.000 be big at some point is quantum
00:41:13.440 Computing um because we saw this you
00:41:16.359 know Ben um you especially I'm sure must
00:41:18.960 have been sort of fascinated by this um
00:41:20.960 Willow chip that Google unveiled this
00:41:23.599 week which what was it so it can do in
00:41:26.720 five minutes what it would take a
00:41:29.280 regular
00:41:30.359 supercomputer 10 septian years to do
00:41:33.599 holy smell which is just
00:41:36.119 mindboggling um and obviously there was
00:41:38.040 a lot of talk about well is this going
00:41:39.440 to be you know a Quantum computer's
00:41:41.119 going to come along and be able to crack
00:41:42.599 Bitcoins encryption and and and the
00:41:44.839 answer is yes but we've still got some
00:41:47.640 time I think but like you know there are
00:41:49.400 there are there are crypto there are
00:41:51.000 crypto projects out there that are kind
00:41:52.440 of focused on Quantum Computing you know
00:41:54.599 a lot of it obviously kind of quantum
00:41:56.040 resistance but so yeah I mean I think
00:41:58.680 there'll be Fascinate there will always
00:42:00.000 be kind of new fascinating narratives to
00:42:02.240 explore that's one of them that I'm
00:42:03.560 going to look at um but um yeah I think
00:42:07.680 that would looking for sort of longer
00:42:10.040 term gains that would be the time
00:42:11.920 hopefully where getting stuff at
00:42:13.720 Absolute rock bottom rock bottom
00:42:17.079 prices yeah yeah Quantum Computing how
00:42:21.280 about you Ben yeah Ben where we going to
00:42:23.800 pull your money a new desk
00:42:27.720 I already got a new task oh I'm sorry
00:42:30.280 I'm sorry you got rid of the cardboard
00:42:32.000 you know I've I've really I'm really
00:42:33.640 interested in the real estate market but
00:42:35.160 every time we look at it you know the
00:42:37.040 math just doesn't math right it doesn't
00:42:38.880 it doesn't Ma and mathing yeah I mean
00:42:41.400 Rob probably knows about you know at
00:42:43.480 least on you know because I mean I know
00:42:44.599 he's in the real estate market and he's
00:42:46.000 been in the real estate market for a
00:42:47.079 long time and I'm not saying there
00:42:48.760 aren't any good deals out there it's
00:42:51.240 just that they're hard to find it's
00:42:53.480 tougher and tougher yeah it's really
00:42:55.000 tough yeah and I I think the hard part
00:42:56.640 is you know this is not including sort
00:42:59.680 of the theoretical gains of the actual
00:43:02.000 house but when you actually calculate
00:43:04.040 out your return from say you know
00:43:06.680 investing in real estate it's not any
00:43:09.440 better right now again this is excluding
00:43:13.160 the appreciation of the house and also
00:43:14.960 excluding potential tax benefits but you
00:43:17.920 know it's only a few percent right I
00:43:20.200 mean it's only a few percent unless
00:43:21.400 you're and and and that's why I think
00:43:23.240 it's really hard for you there's been a
00:43:24.440 lot fewer deals out there um going on I
00:43:27.680 if you look at like real estate
00:43:28.680 transactions they're extremely low right
00:43:30.720 now and one of the reasons of course
00:43:31.680 people don't really want to sell because
00:43:32.880 they locked in like sub 3% 30-year
00:43:34.920 mortgage rates which is essentially free
00:43:37.079 money when a t- bill is giving you four
00:43:39.040 to five percent um so yeah I think it's
00:43:42.440 it'd be nice if if the real estate
00:43:44.319 market started to make a little bit more
00:43:46.520 sense by 2026 uh maybe it will we'll see
00:43:50.520 yeah right now it's like there's the
00:43:52.040 deals are few and far between and if
00:43:53.599 you're looking for something great you
00:43:54.760 got to really dig and something has to
00:43:56.280 kind of come to say okay this is a great
00:43:58.160 one and uh that's it but real estate
00:44:01.720 will go down just like I'm ass sure
00:44:03.559 there's a recession around the corner
00:44:05.200 just like everybody talks
00:44:06.760 about someone says uh c a couple people
00:44:10.280 asked about CPI and PPI um yeah yeah and
00:44:14.119 I I actually forgot that that the PPI
00:44:16.280 came out today but apparently so CPI
00:44:18.119 came in a little bit I mean I think it
00:44:20.160 came in line with expectations it's been
00:44:21.760 going up for the last couple of months
00:44:22.880 but it's still relatively low but I
00:44:24.440 guess about an hour ago PPI came in and
00:44:27.559 it in the uh previous it was
00:44:30.720 2.66% and the estimated for today was
00:44:33.319 2.6 but it actually came in at 3% so it
00:44:37.119 actually came in a little bit higher you
00:44:39.559 actually you can see the dollar the the
00:44:42.000 the dxy got a little bit of a jump today
00:44:45.040 I I think the dollar is probably going
00:44:46.040 to keep rallying into the end of the
00:44:47.359 year just like it did at the end of 2016
00:44:49.240 and that was also after Trump got
00:44:50.800 elected it it just kind of seems like a
00:44:52.920 carbing copy of Q4 2016 uh you know to a
00:44:56.280 large extent but I don't have any other
00:44:58.359 thoughts on it I mean other obviously
00:45:00.000 ppi is a little bit hot um but I I went
00:45:02.920 to go check on on rate cut probabilities
00:45:06.680 and there's a 98% chance that they're
00:45:09.800 GNA cut rates again um so I think a lot
00:45:14.480 of people are confused because it's like
00:45:16.280 well if inflation's trending up and and
00:45:19.880 you know all these markets are putting
00:45:21.319 in new all-time highs and mem coins are
00:45:23.000 flying like what's the incentive to cut
00:45:24.440 rates I guess it's the fact that you
00:45:27.119 know there are some they they want to
00:45:29.680 slow down the labor market weakness
00:45:31.119 right initial claims came in today at
00:45:32.640 like
00:45:33.359 242 uh which is still you know in the
00:45:36.079 200 so not too concerning but I don't
00:45:38.839 know it's it's one of those things where
00:45:40.640 no matter what they do they're probably
00:45:41.880 going to get you know chastised for it
00:45:44.240 in a couple years um yeah true you guys
00:45:48.160 have anything to add to the inflation
00:45:49.760 stuff or should we just move on to the
00:45:50.839 next one my favorite topic
00:45:54.240 no um one of the question
00:45:57.920 I'm kind of curious you guys have if you
00:45:59.880 have any defense for this someone says
00:46:01.240 my biggest point they always have to
00:46:02.280 defend is the energy cost and effect on
00:46:04.359 the environment this is something that
00:46:05.839 kind of pops up a lot I'm assuming
00:46:07.480 they're talking about like mining um and
00:46:10.520 and just sort of securing the networks
00:46:12.319 and whatnot do you guys have any useful
00:46:14.400 counterpoints uh for when someone says
00:46:17.359 you know it's destroying the environment
00:46:19.200 or or something like that as far as
00:46:20.880 crypto is
00:46:23.200 concerned guy you want to take it or
00:46:24.960 I'll take it I I can take it it's it's
00:46:27.200 it's pretty it's relatively simple it's
00:46:30.200 there's a couple different ways that
00:46:31.440 they can do things first of all if
00:46:33.240 they're using if if you're using
00:46:34.760 Renewables wins the worst but if if you
00:46:37.400 can use solar then it's renewable
00:46:39.280 renewable energy source you can use that
00:46:41.000 but on the flip side is this there's
00:46:43.160 this thing called flaring for natural
00:46:44.720 gas when you do a flare essentially you
00:46:46.640 you blowing off the natural gas for
00:46:48.760 excessive compounds what the miners will
00:46:51.079 do is they'll move it closer to these
00:46:52.640 areas and then they will use that
00:46:53.920 trapped energy and they will power up uh
00:46:56.359 their Bitcoin mining operation and
00:46:57.920 because of that they can actually
00:46:59.520 generate income this is happening in
00:47:01.160 small towns in Texas and they're
00:47:02.839 actually gener generating Revenue
00:47:04.720 because of the Bitcoin actually
00:47:05.680 generating jobs another other other part
00:47:07.760 of this is hydroelectric power so if you
00:47:09.720 go to different areas once you have
00:47:11.880 those those paddles or those those uh
00:47:14.280 those devices that actually turn and
00:47:16.240 crank and it actually uh makes that that
00:47:19.440 electrical source that power to get from
00:47:22.119 the primary area to the area of which
00:47:25.200 you are actually using it for reta or
00:47:27.160 commercial whatever else you have some
00:47:28.800 type of electrical energy loss if you
00:47:30.520 can move those Bitcoin miners closer
00:47:32.520 again then you can put those into uh big
00:47:35.599 uh metal bin what are they called the
00:47:39.559 the big huge metal bin storage that they
00:47:41.359 see that you see on trains they'll
00:47:42.480 actually shove you know a couple of
00:47:43.839 thousand miners in there and they'll put
00:47:45.400 it right next to the hydroelectrical
00:47:46.960 source so they can do those types of
00:47:48.760 things and then and we've also seen
00:47:51.160 about these other areas in like again in
00:47:53.559 western parts of Texas where they
00:47:55.480 actually had uh
00:47:57.359 these
00:47:59.440 um areas where it's the big mining or
00:48:03.559 the big web service or plants where they
00:48:06.200 have these like big metal structures big
00:48:07.960 huge buildings and they go belly up and
00:48:10.040 they move out and now they put in the
00:48:11.920 electrical Miners and they have they
00:48:13.240 just kind of reconstitute it so like all
00:48:15.599 these things about electricity and it's
00:48:17.200 not being used if it's used in the right
00:48:19.359 way and constructively you can actually
00:48:21.319 make a ton of of funds and what's great
00:48:23.760 about this is that if you have excessive
00:48:25.200 energy in the location you can tell
00:48:27.520 Bitcoin miners hey we have excessive
00:48:29.040 energy we'll give it to you at a
00:48:30.040 discount or else it's going to be wasted
00:48:32.119 and then of course when there's an
00:48:33.200 overload of the grid we need you guys a
00:48:34.760 shut down and we'll pay you a little bit
00:48:36.319 great we'll shut down and everybody's
00:48:37.880 happy so I don't understand I mean on
00:48:40.040 certain places yes it actually does
00:48:41.839 happen but in most of the places
00:48:43.440 responsibly they can make a huge
00:48:46.760 impact roughly I think it's a good
00:48:49.920 response uh someone wants to
00:48:52.599 know sorry guy did you want to add
00:48:54.720 anything sorry guy yeah no well yeah I
00:48:57.960 mean it's it's this idea of it's this
00:49:00.440 idea of balancing the grid isn't it
00:49:02.119 because I think there's this there's
00:49:03.480 this sense that you know it there's
00:49:05.760 there's energy and uh you know if if
00:49:09.000 Bitcoin miners are are eating it all up
00:49:11.200 then that means there's none left for
00:49:13.559 for you know Granny Smith to to heat her
00:49:16.319 heat her house and it's like it doesn't
00:49:18.000 it doesn't work like that you know the
00:49:19.760 the the the electricity grid is an
00:49:21.559 enormously complex thing and as you say
00:49:23.960 like sometimes there are sometimes there
00:49:26.240 are there is more energy that can be
00:49:28.079 used and that's when you know Bitcoin
00:49:29.960 miners can come in as you say switch on
00:49:32.280 balance the grid and and switch off at
00:49:34.720 other times and yeah and I think you
00:49:37.119 touched as well on this idea that you
00:49:39.480 know people can set up mining operations
00:49:41.880 with with renewable energy and and
00:49:44.839 generate you know generate income in in
00:49:47.359 poor areas I mean this is something that
00:49:48.680 you're seeing a lot of a lot of in
00:49:50.400 Africa at the moment there are quite a
00:49:52.119 few initiatives there where people are
00:49:54.640 you know using sort of solar I think
00:49:56.880 power as well to to to run these small
00:49:59.480 scale mining operations and it provides
00:50:01.720 you know often quite remote communities
00:50:03.680 with with an income and I think it's
00:50:05.799 just you know it's a case of like I
00:50:07.880 think it just underlines the fact that
00:50:10.480 that if we you know if we build more
00:50:12.799 energy infrastructure there is literally
00:50:15.119 nothing that we can't do you know I and
00:50:19.720 anyone says that Bitcoin Bitcoin mining
00:50:21.880 is is just a useless waste no because
00:50:23.799 it's it's it's powering the most secure
00:50:26.440 pay Network on the planet um like these
00:50:29.880 AI data centers you know they are they
00:50:31.839 are producing they they are absolutely
00:50:34.240 eating up electricity but people aren't
00:50:36.160 complaining about that because that's
00:50:37.799 giving people some giving people
00:50:39.319 something in return um and if we build
00:50:42.480 enough if we build enough nuclear power
00:50:44.480 stations if we build enough uh you know
00:50:46.720 other sources of renewable energy then
00:50:48.880 then everyone can do you know all these
00:50:51.200 things can be accomplished and Human
00:50:53.079 Society will take an enormous Leap
00:50:55.440 Forward um it's I think it's very sort
00:50:58.079 of outdated thinking to just be like oh
00:50:59.960 you know oh they're just using up
00:51:01.319 electricity that that that that other
00:51:03.520 people that you know then isn't
00:51:05.280 accessible to other people it's like
00:51:06.920 it's far more com complex far more
00:51:09.440 nuanced than that yeah hey Ben what was
00:51:11.760 that thing you were talking about before
00:51:12.880 like nuclear energy there's like these
00:51:14.480 little nuclear reactors that you can put
00:51:16.280 in small modular yeah small modular
00:51:18.520 reactors how have we ever deployed any
00:51:21.839 of those across anywhere or are they
00:51:23.760 just was this theoretical there are
00:51:26.119 small actors yeah there are some I mean
00:51:28.920 it's not it's not as popular as they
00:51:31.480 probably should be but there are some
00:51:34.760 what's the problem I don't get it
00:51:35.920 because like if we could like what guy
00:51:37.440 said if we can create more energy we'd
00:51:38.680 have more sustainability why can't we
00:51:40.240 make more of those well I mean we could
00:51:42.799 I mean I think a lot of the a lot of the
00:51:44.640 risks associated with anything nuclear
00:51:46.520 is just more so like public perception
00:51:49.240 and and um sort of just regulations
00:51:52.079 right it's almost like uh you know
00:51:53.799 crypto crypto is is sort of under regul
00:51:56.680 at the nuclear industry arguably is over
00:51:59.920 regulated um to the point where like
00:52:02.440 it's almost impossible to get to see any
00:52:04.480 type of change for you know for large
00:52:06.319 periods of time so it's not that there's
00:52:07.480 not any it's just that progress on on
00:52:09.760 deploying that stuff is is extremely
00:52:11.799 slow uh because they want to make sure
00:52:13.799 they're doing it right and and following
00:52:15.960 all the regulations they need to but um
00:52:18.359 but you could argue I mean there yes
00:52:20.280 there have been nuclear accidents right
00:52:22.160 it's not like you know it's not like
00:52:23.559 we're ignoring that but if you were to
00:52:26.280 look at you know sort of deaths
00:52:28.319 associated with you know other types of
00:52:31.680 energy production right whether it's
00:52:33.520 like coal or other things it's not I
00:52:36.720 mean there there's risks there as well
00:52:38.760 right it's not it's not like there's no
00:52:40.160 risks anywhere obviously when it when
00:52:42.119 there's a nuclear accident it it it
00:52:44.280 certainly is is a big deal um and and
00:52:47.880 the few that there have been they've
00:52:49.200 been really publicized um and so sort of
00:52:52.880 like a public perception of nuclear
00:52:56.040 hasn't always been that great and I
00:52:57.720 think that's kind of kept us kept us
00:52:59.599 back from harnessing that but I do think
00:53:01.799 I I do think that what guy said is is
00:53:04.640 absolutely true I mean I think that um
00:53:06.720 you know energy you know you saw the
00:53:09.040 energy problems and there's no really
00:53:11.160 telling where where we could go um I
00:53:14.359 think energy is kind of the one of the
00:53:16.559 biggest limiting factors for us as just
00:53:19.160 a civilization right just producing
00:53:20.880 energy and and enough of and enough of
00:53:22.720 it um and I guess what Rob said also I
00:53:26.079 think it was it was probably it was
00:53:27.520 either Robert Guy where it's sort of the
00:53:30.160 utility I I think a lot of the people
00:53:31.720 that think that it's wasting energy like
00:53:34.280 Bitcoin um they don't see the utility of
00:53:36.720 it right so if you don't see the utility
00:53:38.079 of it they're going to say it's wasting
00:53:39.559 energy but if you actually see the
00:53:40.880 utility of it and you you so you believe
00:53:42.680 in the bit the future of Bitcoin then
00:53:44.760 it's like well I mean it makes sense
00:53:46.040 there's going to be a cost to to have
00:53:48.000 something like that um an energy cost so
00:53:51.240 but I think that's kind of where the
00:53:52.160 disconnect is is the people that
00:53:53.680 actually get it or the the people that
00:53:55.640 don't um here real quick if anybody
00:53:58.960 would like to see a video of Ben talking
00:54:01.520 about Bitcoin mining power and nuclear
00:54:04.000 power together uh please put that in the
00:54:06.720 comment section right now so Ben will
00:54:08.559 actually do it we've already asked him
00:54:10.799 three times no one's interested in that
00:54:16.040 okay Channel Once I had a million
00:54:18.160 subscribers let's do chess uh Rob your
00:54:20.960 favorite topic someone
00:54:24.160 asked someone asked Bitcoin it's going
00:54:26.880 back to 60 I mean look it it already
00:54:29.559 went to 60 now people are getting greedy
00:54:31.960 wanting it to go back what do you think
00:54:33.599 could it go back yeah you know and I I
00:54:36.280 think it could go back I'll tell you why
00:54:37.799 is because if this Bitcoin strategic
00:54:39.440 Reserve like there's already there's a
00:54:41.440 Bitcoin conference going on right now or
00:54:43.079 just got over yesterday or day before in
00:54:45.119 Abu Dhabi and there's been a lot of
00:54:47.000 different uh rumors about the Middle
00:54:49.480 East starting to invest in the Bitcoin
00:54:51.359 strateg strategic Reserve if that
00:54:53.319 actually pops off and what we heard from
00:54:55.200 Eric Trump you know Bitcoin do a million
00:54:57.559 why couldn't it go up because again what
00:55:00.119 I heard and what guy heard was after all
00:55:02.559 this pumps and all the things that were
00:55:03.960 going on hey I heard Bitcoin was over
00:55:05.760 100k that's the winner I think so yeah
00:55:08.160 why not 60% and then it'll go to all
00:55:10.359 coins
00:55:12.359 again it was interesting to uh I was
00:55:15.440 listening to Matt Matt Hogan um on uh
00:55:18.720 bankless the other day obviously Matt
00:55:21.039 Hogan bitwise they have they have a spot
00:55:23.480 ETF and he was saying um which which I
00:55:26.480 found fascinating it's like generally
00:55:28.440 with ETFs year one is absolutely dwarfed
00:55:34.480 by year two and year three oh so you
00:55:38.480 know and obviously the Bitcoin ETFs have
00:55:40.400 been like a r you know a runaway success
00:55:43.240 you can't overstate how successful
00:55:44.760 they've been but he was kind of
00:55:46.440 suggesting it's like if they play out
00:55:48.079 like other ETFs we we haven't even begun
00:55:51.599 like and you know so the allocation I
00:55:53.520 mean black Croc now holds half a million
00:55:57.400 um Black Rock alone holds half a million
00:56:00.559 uh Bitcoin to back ibit the the ETFs
00:56:03.480 overall are now hold over a million more
00:56:05.760 than Satoshi and this is we haven't even
00:56:08.359 had a year so yeah I mean if they go
00:56:10.680 like that then then I think dominance
00:56:12.880 could could could go over could go back
00:56:14.920 to 60 or or maybe even
00:56:17.520 over yeah interesting I know
00:56:20.599 that yeah I mean there are yeah I mean
00:56:23.720 there are certainly when the when the
00:56:25.440 gold ETF launched I mean didn't gold go
00:56:28.520 into a bull market for many many years
00:56:31.799 yeah
00:56:32.720 um so I guess it depends on I mean
00:56:35.440 everyone's somewhat different because
00:56:37.280 when the QQQ launched in
00:56:40.119 1999 the market topped 54 weeks later so
00:56:44.119 so it's not it's not always clear but no
00:56:46.880 I think you're I think you're generally
00:56:48.400 right right like usually it it is a good
00:56:51.000 thing for a while it was a good thing
00:56:52.960 for gold um and for tech stocks it was
00:56:55.280 great for a year yeah and it was so so
00:56:58.599 Ben if if QQQ went roughly a year from
00:57:01.359 the Inception when was the ETF when did
00:57:03.799 we get it approved so the QQQ was
00:57:06.440 approved in March of
00:57:08.039 1999 and CS for Bitcoin it was it was
00:57:13.119 January of
00:57:15.280 2024 okay so here's an interesting thing
00:57:18.119 so I mean I look I I think there's
00:57:20.119 always a good chance Bitcoin just tops
00:57:21.599 when it normally does in late 2025 but
00:57:24.000 there is sort if if the left translated
00:57:26.440 were to play out um there's you know
00:57:30.359 there there's at least a chance that you
00:57:32.000 have to you know be aware of that
00:57:33.640 because the QQQ topped was 54 weeks
00:57:37.760 after it launched and 54 weeks after the
00:57:40.160 Bitcoin ETF launched is Inauguration Day
00:57:46.960 H Co coincidentally um wow but you know
00:57:51.319 and and you know what's really funny
00:57:52.599 about the QQQ is I I've sort of talked
00:57:54.640 about this on my channel some is when it
00:57:56.240 launched it launched at 48 and when
00:57:59.039 bitcoin's ETF launched it launched it
00:58:00.960 hit 48k it's like it launched at like
00:58:02.839 the same the same value and then but the
00:58:05.440 good news the good news is the
00:58:07.319 QQQ um it broke aund 48 weeks later
00:58:12.720 Bitcoin broke a 100K 47 weeks later so
00:58:16.200 Bitcoin Bitcoin was a little bit more
00:58:18.280 successful than the QQQ but the QQQ did
00:58:20.839 end up going up to 120 right so that's
00:58:22.880 the good news it did end up going to 120
00:58:24.520 before it got a pullback and even though
00:58:25.880 it got a pullback A year later the music
00:58:29.520 didn't really stop until a year after
00:58:32.880 that right I mean the the markets were
00:58:34.520 still I mean the QQQ stayed at like a
00:58:37.000 100 for it did get a drop to 60 but then
00:58:41.000 it it bounced back up to 100 and it was
00:58:43.160 at a 100 for another half a year after
00:58:46.319 that you know so you don't you you don't
00:58:49.000 often see these things turn around just
00:58:50.680 on a dime like that so and by the way
00:58:52.799 guys just so one thing to to to to
00:58:54.880 remind people of is if there is a drop
00:58:57.319 in January it doesn't mean it's the
00:58:59.839 cycle top right I mean it obviously if
00:59:01.520 it follows a QQQ it could be but there
00:59:04.079 if you look at historical post having
00:59:07.559 years the last two 2017 and 2021 there
00:59:11.119 was a 30% drop in January of the postt
00:59:14.240 year so do remember that um so even if
00:59:17.760 you do get a drop in January doesn't
00:59:19.160 necessarily mean it's it's the end right
00:59:20.920 it could just be uh could just be your
00:59:22.720 typical January of the post havinge
00:59:24.559 correction U which by the way could just
00:59:26.359 be a pullback to a higher price than the
00:59:27.920 current market is right now um so
00:59:30.520 there's a lot of time between now and
00:59:32.000 and inauguration day uh let's get to
00:59:34.960 actually we're already at 95 let's get
00:59:36.799 to one more question um and then we'll
00:59:39.760 wrap it up uh maybe a more positive
00:59:43.200 thing so
00:59:46.359 uh let me see let me find a positive I'm
00:59:50.680 I'm struggling like look at all these
00:59:52.160 questions like do you think the current
00:59:54.000 ETF inflows turn into outflows during
00:59:56.039 the bare Market pushing the the price
00:59:57.760 lower um actually here's a question uh
01:00:00.400 do you think Tesla will outperform
01:00:02.160 Bitcoin in 2025 Tesla's been on a kind
01:00:05.240 of a tear recently it's up to hit 420
01:00:08.119 something yesterday
01:00:10.359 new yeah do you guys own Tesla I own a
01:00:12.920 little bit but I do I do yeah I I'm I'm
01:00:16.240 a pretty big Tesla Bull and I have been
01:00:17.880 since like
01:00:18.720 2013 um I'm pretty excited about
01:00:22.559 it yeah I I this is a question for you
01:00:25.359 then man I don't know
01:00:28.000 I think
01:00:29.319 um I don't know if it'll outour Bitcoin
01:00:31.640 I mean I do think it'll do well over the
01:00:33.720 next year um if you if you line up sort
01:00:38.079 of the 2016 2017 cycle uh with the
01:00:41.240 current cycle Tesla basically was doing
01:00:44.280 the same exact thing it was doing
01:00:46.319 exactly eight years ago and what it
01:00:48.079 ended up doing was is rallying up it it
01:00:51.079 would correspond to $600 for today's
01:00:54.039 market what it did back then um so I'm
01:00:57.160 hoping to see it go there in 2025 but
01:00:59.839 we'll see I don't know um I I would
01:01:03.599 imagine that um that Elon Musk will
01:01:06.880 be you know 2025 he will be expecting um
01:01:11.480 having scratch Donald Trump's back I I
01:01:13.720 imagine he'll be expecting to get his
01:01:15.119 own back thoroughly scratched so you
01:01:17.359 would imagine that um Tesla will benefit
01:01:20.200 you know from things like these tariffs
01:01:21.559 that Trump is talking about and and and
01:01:23.720 I mean I if I was Elon Musk I'd be
01:01:26.160 pretty pissed off if I didn't get you
01:01:28.920 know if Tesla didn't have an absolutely
01:01:30.720 Stellar year in 2025 because like I'm
01:01:33.200 sure he I'm you know I'm sure he didn't
01:01:35.319 give Trump all that support just for
01:01:38.000 nothing man unburdened by what has
01:01:41.160 been Tesla I mean Tesla was really
01:01:44.640 undervalued against the S&P 500 a few
01:01:47.160 months ago because it was you know you
01:01:49.000 had basically every other you know the
01:01:51.119 original Magnificent Seven essentially I
01:01:52.760 think like all of them were at all-time
01:01:54.160 highs except for Tesla and uh it just
01:01:57.279 seemed like it was relatively
01:01:58.640 undervalued and now it's it's um you
01:02:01.760 know I think its market cap is what like
01:02:03.440 1.3 trillion or something now wow um but
01:02:06.960 there's plenty of companies that are you
01:02:08.880 know over two trillion um so we'll see I
01:02:12.079 mean I think Tesla is a good is a good
01:02:14.599 name to hold long term but it's been on
01:02:16.400 a tear recently so you're you're GNA get
01:02:18.319 a pullback at some point uh I don't know
01:02:20.440 I don't know exactly when that'll be but
01:02:22.240 all right guys we'll go and wrap it up

00:00:00.599 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.080 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.520 to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to
00:00:06.319 be discussing the market cycle return on
00:00:08.920 investment or Roi if you guys like the
00:00:11.599 content make sure you subscribe to the
00:00:13.160 channel give the video a thumbs up and
00:00:15.040 check out the sale on intothe
00:00:16.520 cryptoverse premium at intothe crypt.of
00:00:30.320 is in fact tracking so the way we have
00:00:33.160 it broken up here is we have it broken
00:00:35.600 up into five separate Market
00:00:38.360 Cycles there is some validity to the
00:00:41.559 idea of making Market cycle one and
00:00:45.360 Market cycle 2 into the same cycle but
00:00:49.840 because there was an 80% drop or more um
00:00:54.239 you know between them that that last for
00:00:57.160 you know at least more than a couple of
00:00:58.559 days that's why they're sort of separ R
00:01:00.160 it out so what I'd like to do is just
00:01:02.600 really focus on the current market cycle
00:01:05.680 and the last two Market Cycles when you
00:01:08.680 measure the ROI of Bitcoin from the low
00:01:12.400 you'll actually notice that the purple
00:01:14.360 line right here you actually notice is
00:01:16.640 it's actually right in between the last
00:01:19.119 two Market Cycles as measured from the
00:01:21.479 low in fact at this point in the cycle
00:01:24.799 two cycles ago so Market cycle three the
00:01:27.400 ROI of Bitcoin at this point in the
00:01:29.320 cycle was about
00:01:30.479 5.55 X right now this cycle bitcoin's
00:01:35.040 Roi as measured from the low is 6.1 7x
00:01:39.360 last cycle at this point the ROI was 9.9
00:01:43.079 3x so you can actually see the ROI is
00:01:46.719 between the last two cycles so it's it's
00:01:49.759 kind of fascinating how how history has
00:01:52.399 somewhat repeated itself now that
00:01:54.280 doesn't mean that it's always going to
00:01:55.320 stay just between those two cycles in
00:01:57.600 fact at some point the General
00:02:00.320 expectation should be I think that it
00:02:03.759 would fall below the third cycle Roi and
00:02:08.520 that's not necessarily going to be a
00:02:10.479 popular view um but it's the same thing
00:02:13.000 as last cycle when everyone was sort of
00:02:15.599 we were all debating like diminishing
00:02:17.200 returns and whatnot and and whether it
00:02:18.920 would actually follow through to the
00:02:20.480 very end I know a lot of people thought
00:02:22.599 it would and you can't necessarily blame
00:02:25.000 them for thinking that I mean at some
00:02:26.519 point the last cycle Roi was even higher
00:02:29.480 than the cycle that came before it but
00:02:32.000 as we got closer to the end of the cycle
00:02:34.000 you can see that it did fall short of
00:02:36.560 the prior cycle and so I would argue
00:02:40.000 you'll probably be you'll probably see
00:02:42.120 something similar this time around right
00:02:44.280 where it looks like it might track the
00:02:45.879 entire way but at some point we likely
00:02:48.360 will get some form of diminishing
00:02:50.280 returns I I mean just to give you an
00:02:52.360 idea two cycles ago the ROI of Bitcoin
00:02:55.360 from the bottom was a 100x move the
00:02:58.080 reason why that's hard to you you know
00:03:00.080 experience later in later Cycles is
00:03:02.319 because it just takes exponentially more
00:03:03.959 money to move the market but all in all
00:03:06.799 Bitcoin is still tracking the last two
00:03:09.440 Market Cycles one interesting thing to
00:03:11.840 do is just as a thought experiment to
00:03:14.640 take April 2021 as the peak rather than
00:03:18.440 um you know rather than uh November now
00:03:21.840 of course it's not going to have much of
00:03:23.080 an effect when you look at it like this
00:03:25.280 but where it could have an effect is
00:03:26.799 when you measure the ROI of Bitcoin from
00:03:29.879 the peak right so in the same way we're
00:03:32.120 going to look at the market cycle Roi we
00:03:33.840 did it from the low now we're going to
00:03:35.640 look at it as measured from the peak if
00:03:38.120 you take November 2021 as the peak you
00:03:40.760 can see that Bitcoin this cycle is
00:03:42.920 actually right in between the last two
00:03:44.799 cycles as measured Peak to Peak at this
00:03:47.360 point in the last cycle Bitcoin was up
00:03:51.400 um about what's that 1.84 X from the
00:03:55.720 prior Peak two cycles ago at this point
00:03:58.519 it was basically just at the prior Peak
00:04:00.400 so a 1X and this cycle you can see that
00:04:04.439 it's up about 45% from the prior Peak so
00:04:07.079 about 1.4 5x so it's actually right in
00:04:10.079 between the last two cycles but if you
00:04:12.760 take it as measured from April 2021 you
00:04:16.320 can see that it it looks a little bit
00:04:18.440 different right and there's some
00:04:19.720 validity to doing that um I just wanted
00:04:22.520 to show what it would look like if you
00:04:24.120 measured it from April 2021 rather than
00:04:26.840 measure it from November I do think
00:04:28.520 November is the better way to measure it
00:04:31.199 um because at the end of the day price
00:04:33.280 action is King not the indicators that
00:04:35.639 told us that April was the top and not
00:04:37.400 November at the end of the day bitcoin's
00:04:39.880 price topped in November of
00:04:42.479 2021 so that's how you measure it from
00:04:45.039 the low that's how you measure it from
00:04:47.039 the peak and what's really interesting
00:04:48.840 is if you measure it from the peak like
00:04:50.840 this you know and you compare it to the
00:04:53.440 2016 2017 cycle you can see that Bitcoin
00:04:57.600 again is actually quite a bit above
00:05:00.120 where it was at this point in the 2016
00:05:02.919 2017 cycle in fact it also had a move
00:05:05.440 around this time and it was actually
00:05:06.960 near around this time where it got a
00:05:08.600 little bit of a correction before
00:05:10.039 continuing on so just something to keep
00:05:12.039 in mind but again if you switch this
00:05:13.360 over to April it does look a little bit
00:05:16.039 different the other way to measure the
00:05:18.240 ROI uh you know sort of the market cycle
00:05:20.400 Roi is to just look at the ROI after the
00:05:22.680 having um and of course there's always
00:05:25.639 that first cycle we can look at but the
00:05:27.360 volatility back then was just insane so
00:05:29.759 like to often just compare it to the
00:05:31.160 last two cycles and in this way
00:05:33.400 bitcoin's Roi as measured from the
00:05:36.600 having is actually lower than the prior
00:05:39.639 Cycles now what's interesting is we've
00:05:41.720 seen this sort of this even the cyclical
00:05:44.400 Behavior surrounding the Bitcoin
00:05:59.639 Cycles 1 and three having cycle 1 and
00:06:01.800 three it never went below it um even if
00:06:05.160 you measure it out to the bottom the
00:06:06.560 future bottom you can see that it never
00:06:08.080 went below it but when you look at
00:06:11.280 having Cycles 2 and four you'll notice
00:06:14.639 that after the having they both saw the
00:06:16.880 price of Bitcoin drop below where it was
00:06:20.280 when the having occurred so I thought
00:06:22.520 that was an interesting uh thing to sort
00:06:25.479 of talk about and think about um and I I
00:06:28.360 wonder if the reason is because everyone
00:06:31.199 always has sort of the last cycle in
00:06:33.400 mind because that's more fresh in
00:06:35.199 everyone's mind they they obviously made
00:06:36.840 a mistakes and every you know the last
00:06:38.360 cycle and so in the next cycle they want
00:06:40.280 to make sure they don't have those same
00:06:42.120 mistakes so they end up doing things
00:06:44.400 different than the prior cycle and so
00:06:46.360 perhaps the cycle plays out a little bit
00:06:47.880 differently um so it almost seems like
00:06:50.840 to get some um you know to get some
00:06:53.840 level of insight into the market you
00:06:56.400 almost have to look back two cycles to
00:06:58.240 see what was going on and that was one
00:07:00.120 of the things back in you know in in
00:07:02.000 March and April we talked about a lot is
00:07:03.639 that I think a lot of people were just
00:07:05.000 looking at last cycle and assuming that
00:07:07.280 Bitcoin would you know would not go
00:07:09.680 below the price at the point of the
00:07:11.599 having when it started to move up
00:07:13.199 because that's what happened last time
00:07:15.160 but if you looked two time you know two
00:07:17.080 cycles ago you would have seen that that
00:07:18.919 would have been a fairly normal uh thing
00:07:21.240 to expect so there you have it I mean
00:07:23.560 that's the the market cycle Roi of
00:07:26.039 Bitcoin more or less it's
00:07:29.960 doing what it normally does I mean again
00:07:32.240 as measured from the having this has
00:07:34.400 actually been the the you know the
00:07:36.800 weakest cycle and actually the last two
00:07:39.960 cycles Bitcoin you can
00:07:41.800 see it actually had a correction um in
00:07:45.639 in both the last two cycles starting in
00:07:47.400 about 10 days or so now I don't know if
00:07:49.199 that's going to happen again this time
00:07:50.919 there's obviously some precedent for
00:07:52.599 Bitcoin sort of rally I mean if you look
00:07:54.759 at again we've talked about the QQQ it
00:07:56.360 rallied into the launch a year the so
00:07:58.919 the one- year anniversary after it
00:08:00.360 launched you could see something you
00:08:01.960 know Bitcoin do something like that but
00:08:05.120 again there was a little bit of a
00:08:06.759 correction by Bitcoin sort of coming up
00:08:10.199 um within the next couple of weeks or
00:08:12.360 so as measured from the last two cycles
00:08:14.680 when you look at it as measured from the
00:08:15.960 having before it continued and if you
00:08:18.280 look at again from the cycle bottom
00:08:21.520 Bitcoin is basically right where it was
00:08:25.919 in the last couple of Cycles where if
00:08:27.199 you were to take the average um it would
00:08:29.240 it would probably line up quite well if
00:08:31.120 you take it again from the peak you can
00:08:34.080 see that Bitcoin is ahead of where it
00:08:37.760 was it's basically at the same spot it
00:08:39.919 was last cycle around this time it's not
00:08:41.760 too far off but it's actually quite a
00:08:43.519 bit further ahead of two cycles ago
00:08:47.000 what's really interesting is that two
00:08:49.000 cycles ago we're currently on day
00:08:51.959 1127 on day 1134 two cycles ago Bitcoin
00:08:56.640 was still 31% down from the prior
00:09:00.560 all-time
00:09:02.040 high now in this case the prior alltime
00:09:04.480 high was 69k and we're obviously well
00:09:07.120 above
00:09:08.279 it we're well above it so it does go to
00:09:11.360 show um you know just how heated this
00:09:14.560 cycle has been especially when you
00:09:16.120 compare it to the 2016 2017 cycle what's
00:09:19.200 really fascinating is that if even if
00:09:21.120 Bitcoin were 30% below the prior
00:09:23.040 all-time high right it would actually
00:09:24.920 still be tracking the 2016 2017 cycle as
00:09:28.800 measured from the peak now if you take
00:09:30.360 that Peak from April obviously you would
00:09:32.680 you know you would see a completely
00:09:33.760 different story and there's no denying
00:09:35.640 that you know measuring it from April
00:09:37.160 does look somewhat uncanny right it
00:09:40.000 looks like it's been tracking relatively
00:09:42.720 closely so just keep an eye on those as
00:09:44.560 measured from the peak as measured from
00:09:46.480 the bottom and as measured from the
00:09:48.120 having and the other thing to
00:09:49.320 potentially look at is the year-to DAT
00:09:50.680 Roi of Bitcoin in
00:09:52.760 2024 if you compare it to Prior having
00:09:55.000 Years 2012 2016 and 2020 you can see
00:09:58.880 that it's BAS basically tracking uh the
00:10:01.040 average of those you can even overlay
00:10:02.920 the average of those and see that
00:10:04.880 Bitcoin has in fact been tracking them
00:10:07.959 fairly closely right the average um
00:10:11.240 especially in in in recent weeks the the
00:10:13.800 the price of Bitcoin in the having year
00:10:16.440 uh the ROI of Bitcoin in the having year
00:10:18.600 on average at this point is 2.32 X and
00:10:23.279 right now in 2024 Bitcoin is up 2.2 1X
00:10:26.920 so this is one of the things about
00:10:28.399 Bitcoin that you know it's a really
00:10:30.760 interesting property that it has that it
00:10:32.680 does tend to follow this cyclical
00:10:34.160 Behavior but also you know looks can be
00:10:36.360 deceiving while it does seem like it's
00:10:37.920 tracking prior having years the closest
00:10:40.120 I would actually push back against that
00:10:41.920 and say it looks really like it's
00:10:43.480 tracking 2023 the closest you know out
00:10:45.880 of all the prior years I I imagine that
00:10:48.480 2023 looks to be you know resembles
00:10:53.240 2024 a lot more than any other year
00:10:55.560 right and there's not a lot of years
00:10:56.560 where you see it sort of go up like this
00:10:58.800 come back down and then go up again in
00:11:01.320 the last part of the Year obviously
00:11:02.880 something like that happened in
00:11:04.560 2021 um so there's it's not like there's
00:11:07.639 no comparisons but even in 2021 you know
00:11:11.480 it it it went up further and then it had
00:11:13.200 a much larger crash in the middle of the
00:11:15.200 year and then it did go up in Q4 but
00:11:18.240 then it it sort of topped out um a
00:11:20.760 little bit earlier so something you know
00:11:23.200 certainly to keep in mind and obviously
00:11:25.760 you know the the ROI Bitcoin could
00:11:27.480 always fall off of Prior cycle at some
00:11:29.920 point it could either go ahead it could
00:11:32.600 fall behind um you know the last thing
00:11:35.120 to consider is if you measure it from
00:11:37.079 the
00:11:38.000 bottom uh you know last cycle at one
00:11:40.839 point it got ahead and then it fell back
00:11:43.320 in line and then it started to
00:11:44.680 accelerate and then we got a landing now
00:11:46.519 there's no guarantee we get a landing
00:11:48.079 but you can kind of see that this cycle
00:11:51.279 it sort of got ahead and then it got
00:11:53.800 back in line and then it's starting to
00:11:55.600 accelerate so kind of an interesting way
00:11:57.760 to think about the market obviously
00:11:59.800 there's a lot to digest there but I just
00:12:01.360 wanted to show people sort of the the
00:12:03.560 the bigger picture view of bitcoin's Roi
00:12:06.399 as measured from the low as measured
00:12:08.279 from the peak as measured from the
00:12:09.959 having and the year-to DAT Roi

# Bitcoin: Market Value to Realized Value Z-Score
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/f9Hazi5zO1Y

00:00:00.680 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.120 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.560 to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to
00:00:06.480 be discussing the market value to
00:00:09.280 realized value zcore or mvrv zcore if
00:00:13.920 you guys like the content make sure you
00:00:15.559 subscribe to the channel give the video
00:00:16.800 a thumbs up and also check out the sale
00:00:18.640 on into the cryptoverse premium at
00:00:21.080 intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead
00:00:24.240 and jump in so the mvrv zcore is
00:00:27.880 something that has his ially been useful
00:00:32.200 for helping us to better identify you
00:00:35.000 know true euphoric Mania phases it can
00:00:39.680 also be used to identify Market cycle
00:00:42.840 bottoms so we essentially have three
00:00:47.440 different lines on the chart right the
00:00:48.879 first thing we have the blue line which
00:00:51.120 is the market cap of Bitcoin the orange
00:00:55.520 line that's just below the blue line
00:00:58.199 that is the realized C
00:01:00.719 okay that's the realized cap if you look
00:01:03.600 at the this line right here this is the
00:01:07.040 MV rvz score now the mvrv Z score is
00:01:10.479 just simply equal to the market cap of
00:01:13.640 Bitcoin minus the realiz cap divided by
00:01:17.960 the standard deviation of the market cap
00:01:21.079 so the the the cool thing about this
00:01:23.200 metric is that essentially whenever the
00:01:27.240 market cap of Bitcoin goes below the
00:01:31.119 realiz cap that tends to
00:01:34.479 Mark Market cycle bottoms right you can
00:01:37.119 see in 2011 and in 2015 and in 2018 and
00:01:41.759 then again in
00:01:43.399 2022 so whenever you see that go below
00:01:45.920 zero that's historically been a a low or
00:01:50.680 pretty close to it right pretty close to
00:01:52.920 I mean you can see this past cycle it
00:01:54.119 went below it um and then it went below
00:01:56.159 it once more about you know almost half
00:01:59.000 a year later or
00:02:00.479 so it can also be used to help us
00:02:03.680 identify sort of true euphoric Mania
00:02:07.479 phases now if you go back and look at
00:02:09.720 last cycle there was sort of a a
00:02:12.239 midcycle top in June of 2019 and if you
00:02:16.400 looked at the mvrv Z score you could see
00:02:18.800 that at that top the mvz score only went
00:02:22.239 up to about
00:02:24.680 2.67 however historically Market cycle
00:02:28.959 tops for bit coin corresponded to mvrb Z
00:02:32.480 scores that
00:02:34.280 were basically between s and 11 or so
00:02:40.159 this might have gone slightly yeah this
00:02:42.000 is around 11 so between seven and 11 so
00:02:46.360 back in 2019 to help us identify that
00:02:50.560 this was a midcycle top and not a market
00:02:53.519 cycle top we were able to look at the
00:02:54.879 mvrv zcore but then in 2021 you can see
00:03:00.200 that the MVR VZ score went all the way
00:03:02.959 up to
00:03:05.760 seven right seven and that was sort of a
00:03:09.720 a warning signal that the market was
00:03:12.040 getting pretty heated this is actually
00:03:14.599 further Evidence you know a lot of
00:03:16.200 people talk about this that in 2021 sort
00:03:18.519 of the real top was early on and then we
00:03:20.640 sort of had you know like um a dead cat
00:03:24.640 bounce that somehow made its way to a
00:03:26.319 new all-time high so perhaps it's not
00:03:28.200 best called a dead cat bounce but and
00:03:30.080 ultimately I think price action is king
00:03:31.920 So you sort of respect price over the
00:03:33.840 indicator but you can understand why a
00:03:35.760 lot of people were more convinced of the
00:03:38.000 first top than the second top now we
00:03:41.640 also had a top in March by the NBR bz
00:03:46.159 score that also hit three now remember
00:03:49.080 the one in
00:03:50.280 2019 hit around 2.67 now back in March
00:03:54.720 we suggested that this was likely not a
00:03:56.920 market cycle top but a mid cycle top
00:04:01.319 essentially you know sort of an early
00:04:03.400 top that occurs where the Euphoria kind
00:04:06.079 of front runs everything and then we
00:04:07.640 have to spend a while going down before
00:04:09.879 we then pick back up again so you could
00:04:12.840 look at a chart like this and and simply
00:04:15.760 say all right well it made sense that
00:04:18.320 this was not the market cycle top
00:04:20.759 because the MV RBZ score only went to
00:04:22.880 three and historically Market cycle tops
00:04:26.199 for Bitcoin have corresponded to when
00:04:28.320 the mbz score hit somewhere between like
00:04:31.320 7 to 10 right around 7 to 10 in fact the
00:04:37.120 first cycle top the MV rvz score topped
00:04:40.520 out at around
00:04:41.919 7.68 the last one topped out at around
00:04:46.400 7.15 so and you can see sort of the ones
00:04:49.360 in between went even higher again right
00:04:52.880 now the mvrv Square High For This cycle
00:04:55.919 is
00:04:57.120 3.29 but this is another metric that you
00:05:00.520 know that certainly could be useful in
00:05:02.919 helping to confirm whether a high
00:05:06.759 corresponds to a market cycle top or you
00:05:10.039 know if that true euphoric sentiment is
00:05:12.880 there or if we just think it's there
00:05:15.440 right and that's kind of the thing about
00:05:16.840 you know back in March 2024 it it felt
00:05:20.919 like the market was overheated and it
00:05:24.000 was right we got a midcycle top but a
00:05:27.560 look at this chart would have helped to
00:05:29.039 suggest it was not in fact the market
00:05:31.479 cycle top so I do think this is just
00:05:33.400 another chart that we can put sort of in
00:05:35.639 our toolkit to help us better navigate
00:05:38.800 Bitcoin again you can get access to it
00:05:41.160 um at intothe cryptoverse decom we do
00:05:44.080 have the sale going on we'll go ahead
00:05:45.840 and wrap it up there uh thank you guys
00:05:47.639 for tuning in subscribe give video a
00:05:49.240 thumbs up and I'll see you guys next

00:00:00.760 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.200 into the crypto today we're going to
00:00:04.720 talk about Bitcoin and we're going to be
00:00:06.720 discussing Market Cycle Theory if you
00:00:09.480 guys like the content make sure you
00:00:10.960 subscribe to the channel give the video
00:00:12.160 a thumbs up and also check out the sale
00:00:14.440 on into the cryptoverse premium at
00:00:16.400 intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead
00:00:19.240 and jump in so in this video what we
00:00:22.480 would like to try to
00:00:24.960 identify is where in the cycle are we
00:00:29.199 because it's easy to assume that this
00:00:32.279 time is different it's easy to assume
00:00:34.960 all sorts of things but what I'd like to
00:00:36.960 do is just go to what does the data
00:00:39.600 suggest right put the narratives aside
00:00:42.879 whether you're bullish or bearish what
00:00:45.079 does the data suggest and let's look at
00:00:48.360 the data in different ways so that we're
00:00:51.039 not caught off guard right it's easy to
00:00:53.520 get caught off guard and I want to go
00:00:55.760 through this as systematically as
00:00:57.359 possible what I would argue is is the
00:01:00.480 best thing to do is to be somewhat
00:01:02.120 flexible right you don't really want to
00:01:04.559 you know sort of nail yourself down to a
00:01:08.439 single outcome in fact furthermore as I
00:01:12.240 have stated in essentially all prior
00:01:14.720 videos where we talk about Market Cycles
00:01:17.439 I do not trade market Cycle Theory at
00:01:21.200 all right I don't trade that at all I
00:01:24.759 trade the risk levels right so as I've
00:01:28.159 mentioned in 2021 one yes there was a
00:01:32.000 top
00:01:33.000 here but the risk levels were actually
00:01:36.360 screaming that this was the top okay now
00:01:39.479 as I've said before all models are wrong
00:01:41.759 some are useful but most models would
00:01:44.759 have told you that April was the top and
00:01:47.880 not
00:01:48.920 November right so at the end of the day
00:01:52.200 Market Cycle Theory is more so an
00:01:54.640 academic exercise now a lot of you guys
00:01:56.560 I know don't even hold Bitcoin um you're
00:01:59.640 more or so knee deep in the altcoin
00:02:01.600 market and you you probably wish I would
00:02:04.600 spend more time talking about about the
00:02:06.600 altcoin market but remember the Bitcoin
00:02:08.840 Market Cycles sort of dictate what the
00:02:11.200 altcoin market does so whether you have
00:02:12.959 Bitcoin or not is kind of irrelevant it
00:02:15.879 is still useful to understand the Cycles
00:02:19.000 just so you know right is there upside
00:02:21.080 for your altcoin or is there not okay so
00:02:24.680 we're going to look at this in a few
00:02:25.920 different ways and I'm trying to you
00:02:27.360 know I would like to argue don't get
00:02:29.360 married to any single outcome we always
00:02:32.440 must respect what the market is telling
00:02:35.840 us all right the first place to start
00:02:39.200 right the first place that I think we
00:02:40.560 should start is go look at just the ROI
00:02:45.080 of Bitcoin from the low right it's easy
00:02:48.280 for anyone to say this time is different
00:02:51.080 and everything else but let's tune out
00:02:53.560 the noise and
00:02:55.519 say let's just look at the ROI of
00:02:58.800 Bitcoin at as measured from the bottom
00:03:02.239 now if you're new you're probably
00:03:03.640 wondering well what low am I even
00:03:06.040 talking about well Bitcoin has this
00:03:08.959 cyclical component to it where it tends
00:03:12.480 to bottom out in Q4 of the midterm year
00:03:16.680 in 2014 it actually technically bottomed
00:03:18.959 out in January of the prehab year but it
00:03:22.000 was still around Q4 of 2014 here's Q4 of
00:03:26.959 2018 and finally Q4 of 2022 so you can
00:03:31.319 see you know this cyclical component of
00:03:35.840 Bitcoin where you get Market cycle
00:03:38.599 bottoms around the end of the midterm
00:03:42.200 year right Q4 2014 Q4 2018 and finally
00:03:47.040 Q4 of
00:03:49.080 2022 and remarkably you've also seen
00:03:52.959 peaks in Q4 of Po having years right so
00:03:58.439 you have your Q Q4 sorry you have your
00:04:01.519 your Q4 of um I can fix this let me go
00:04:06.480 here so you have your Q4 of
00:04:08.640 2013 right and that was your your your
00:04:11.079 first major one right there and then you
00:04:13.319 have your Q4 of
00:04:16.320 2017 and then finally you have your
00:04:20.839 Q4 of 2021 right so you can kind of see
00:04:26.199 what I'm talking about right where you
00:04:29.080 have these Peaks that are separated by
00:04:32.080 about 4
00:04:34.440 years right and the bottoms that are
00:04:38.039 separated by about four years
00:04:41.560 approximately okay so if this continues
00:04:46.240 to hold true then it would mean the next
00:04:50.039 bottom right whenever you know whatever
00:04:52.199 the price would be no one knows what the
00:04:53.800 price would be and we don't technically
00:04:55.320 know when it would correspond in time as
00:04:57.440 well but if it were to play out the same
00:05:00.400 way as it has previously it would mean
00:05:02.960 that the next low is sometime out in say
00:05:05.840 Q4 of 2026 okay now again markets can
00:05:09.880 change obviously and no one knows
00:05:12.080 exactly how things are going to play out
00:05:14.280 but if history were to repeat itself it
00:05:17.680 would mean that the next Market cycle
00:05:19.840 bottom would be in Q4 of 2026 and the
00:05:23.440 next Market cycle top would be in Q4 of
00:05:26.840 2025 right so that's essentially what it
00:05:30.000 would mean and and and you you know you
00:05:32.120 would essentially you would basically
00:05:34.199 have and I don't know exactly where it
00:05:36.039 would correspond to right but you would
00:05:37.280 basically have sort of a top uh in in Q4
00:05:40.240 of 2025 and then some type of low in Q4
00:05:43.680 of 2026 and that way you basically just
00:05:45.960 continue this pattern right that is one
00:05:52.199 Theory okay and
00:05:55.000 look it's a compelling one no doubt
00:05:58.199 about it right no doubt about it for
00:06:00.039 everything that feels like this time is
00:06:02.479 different when you go look at the ROI
00:06:04.880 from the bottom and you look at the ROI
00:06:07.599 today compared to the last couple of
00:06:09.919 Cycles it's right where it always is in
00:06:12.639 fact it's actually outperforming the
00:06:14.759 2016 2017 cycle as measured from the
00:06:17.680 bottom it's underperforming last cycle
00:06:20.960 as measured from the bottom in fact at
00:06:23.039 this point last cycle Bitcoin was up
00:06:26.479 about almost 12x from the low
00:06:30.960 this cycle at this point in the cycle
00:06:33.160 bitcoin's only up a little less than 7x
00:06:35.880 whereas two cycles ago Bitcoin was up
00:06:38.080 about 5 and a2x at this point in the
00:06:41.039 cycle so for all the reasons why every
00:06:45.759 cycle can feel different when you look
00:06:48.560 back at this chart I guess the the
00:06:51.479 question is well show me on the chart
00:06:52.919 where it is different and you could
00:06:55.360 argue that so far it has not been
00:06:57.680 different and so if you look at the last
00:06:59.160 two Cycles you can see that last cycle
00:07:02.360 topped after um 1,60 days from the
00:07:06.319 bottom two cycles ago topped 1068 days
00:07:10.280 from the bottom and we're currently
00:07:12.479 sitting at 758 days from the bottom
00:07:17.280 right
00:07:19.240 so this is your normal cycle your normal
00:07:25.120 4-year cycle where you have a uh a right
00:07:29.960 translated peak in the cycle right so
00:07:33.400 where the low occurs way over
00:07:37.479 here about a year after the top and then
00:07:40.720 you spend basically the next three years
00:07:42.240 going up so one way to visualize that
00:07:45.360 right if we were to take a uh a
00:07:47.840 rectangle here one way to visualize that
00:07:50.319 is to look at it you know sort of from
00:07:54.000 the lows right so we're going to go um
00:07:56.240 from the low to the high and we'll mark
00:07:59.280 that with a green box right so we'll do
00:08:02.240 it for every single
00:08:04.960 cycle the low to the high and really you
00:08:08.720 know this first low You could argue was
00:08:12.560 I mean if you go back to this would be
00:08:15.240 you know December 2014 so the the the
00:08:17.639 one previously would just be December of
00:08:20.520 2010 right which is right here right I
00:08:23.000 mean or sorry that's January 201 I guess
00:08:25.000 December of 2010 uh is right here right
00:08:29.720 here so again you know it's it's a
00:08:32.360 little squirly over there um but you get
00:08:35.958 the idea right you sort of see most of
00:08:37.799 the upside occur during those three
00:08:41.080 years and then you get your onee bare
00:08:46.760 Market okay so let's highlight this so
00:08:49.440 that everyone can see what I'm talking
00:08:50.920 about as it relates to bitcoin uh Market
00:08:55.080 Cycle Theory right so you have your
00:08:59.959 boxes like that okay so this is what a
00:09:04.839 typical fouryear cycle looks like where
00:09:09.519 you have a right translated Peak where
00:09:13.440 the peak occurs just one year before the
00:09:17.120 bottom you see it it's pretty obvious
00:09:20.640 how how the Cycles have historically
00:09:22.600 worked out and so that is why there is a
00:09:25.920 lot of speculation that the next Peak
00:09:28.360 will be sometime
00:09:30.360 late 2025 right you know some people say
00:09:33.160 December 2025 some people would say you
00:09:36.279 know November I've seen some people say
00:09:38.560 you know as early as uh September or
00:09:41.800 July and then furthermore you have
00:09:43.959 people that even suggest it could come
00:09:45.880 sooner right now I would argue that if
00:09:50.240 it comes in the second half of
00:09:53.160 2025 like it always has then it's just a
00:09:57.360 typical right transl ated cycle where
00:10:00.920 then you get sort of a one-year bare
00:10:02.720 Market in the midterm year that is what
00:10:06.440 has historically happen and therefore I
00:10:09.560 think there is a sufficient amount of
00:10:11.800 weight to put behind that idea right you
00:10:14.680 know why try to over complicate
00:10:16.959 something when it just keeps doing the
00:10:19.600 same thing with that in mind though it
00:10:22.360 doesn't mean that you shouldn't be
00:10:23.959 prepared for other outcomes and so what
00:10:27.720 I'd like to do is say all right well
00:10:29.560 look this seems to be a likely outcome
00:10:33.600 right just repeat what it's always done
00:10:35.920 if it's not broke don't fix it but last
00:10:39.680 cycle a lot of people were called off
00:10:41.440 guard you guys remember because the top
00:10:44.240 sort of occurred in April now
00:10:46.639 technically speaking Bitcoin did sweep
00:10:48.279 the high half a year later but for all
00:10:51.200 intense and purposes I mean Bitcoin
00:10:52.560 topped in April of 2021 that was when
00:10:55.639 social activity topped that was when
00:10:58.040 onchain activity topped it was basically
00:11:01.079 when everything else topped except for
00:11:04.040 the actual price of Bitcoin right it's
00:11:07.200 kind of remarkable and and you can
00:11:08.399 actually observe that fairly well I mean
00:11:10.560 if you just go over here and you look at
00:11:13.279 at the social risk for instance you will
00:11:15.639 see that the social interest in crypto
00:11:17.800 really topped out early in the year and
00:11:19.560 ever ever since then it's you those
00:11:21.000 lower highs if you were to go look at
00:11:23.519 say the uh some of the onchain data
00:11:26.200 right if you go look at at say some of
00:11:28.079 the the the Huddle waves the hot ways
00:11:29.880 right whatever you prefer if you were to
00:11:31.639 go look at long-term holders they were
00:11:34.800 selling into the first Peak not really
00:11:37.639 the second one right and so that is a
00:11:40.040 lot of evidence to suggest that April
00:11:44.079 was actually the top not November one
00:11:47.560 really interesting thing about what
00:11:49.120 happened last
00:11:50.279 cycle is what normally happens is
00:11:53.399 Bitcoin goes to the 50e moving average
00:11:57.079 and when it hits the 50e moving average
00:11:59.279 average
00:12:01.040 historically the cycle is over but the
00:12:04.200 market starting to change a little bit
00:12:05.920 because look over here in
00:12:09.519 2014 right in 2014 you can see that
00:12:12.480 Bitcoin hit the 50e moving average and
00:12:15.600 then it got a deadcat bounce to a lower
00:12:18.519 high
00:12:20.360 okay and then the the the party was over
00:12:23.120 right once the 50e moving average was
00:12:25.480 tagged the party was over go to the next
00:12:28.600 cycle
00:12:29.959 here once the 50e estimate was tagged it
00:12:33.199 meant the party was over and you can
00:12:34.920 also see that it tagged it around the
00:12:36.199 same time right March of the midterm
00:12:38.880 year this was also March of the midterm
00:12:41.800 year right March April of the midterm
00:12:43.600 year the year after the post having year
00:12:46.839 and it meant the cycle was
00:12:49.160 over even even the 2019 rally right even
00:12:52.760 the 2019 rally once you went back to the
00:12:55.199 50e SMA you got a little bit of a bounce
00:12:58.199 and then we got our uh the pandemic
00:12:59.839 induced recession
00:13:02.160 right last cycle is where things changed
00:13:04.839 a little bit we hit the 50e moving
00:13:07.839 average and it made a lot of people
00:13:10.040 believe that the cycle was over right it
00:13:12.600 made a lot of people believe the cycle
00:13:13.959 was over and you could argue that
00:13:17.160 realistically it was you know Bitcoin
00:13:19.920 did go a little bit higher but was it
00:13:23.000 worth the risk and I think that's the
00:13:25.040 question was it really worth the risk
00:13:27.959 Just To See It Go say like 5% above the
00:13:30.600 prior all-time high you know would it
00:13:32.360 have been just better to sell here
00:13:34.399 because that was what the risk metrics
00:13:35.760 were saying the risk metrics were saying
00:13:37.079 sell there
00:13:39.199 um so this is kind of what I think got a
00:13:41.800 lot of people off sides last cycle is
00:13:44.440 they thought this was they thought the
00:13:47.079 market cycle was over in
00:13:49.519 April it came back down hit the 50 we
00:13:53.160 moving average like it always
00:13:55.040 does but then it went to a new all-time
00:13:57.800 high right
00:13:59.560 so what's really interesting is this
00:14:01.360 cycle Bitcoin has already tagged the 50e
00:14:04.720 moving average you see that and it's
00:14:06.600 gone to a new all-time high so what I'd
00:14:10.240 like to do here is think about this in a
00:14:15.079 different way right so what I want to do
00:14:19.519 is
00:14:20.639 remember historically Bitcoin tops out
00:14:24.120 in Q4 historically and there's a good
00:14:28.000 chance that happens again
00:14:29.560 but again I don't trade market Cycle
00:14:31.360 Theory I trade the risk levels and I
00:14:33.440 will say that over and over and over
00:14:35.639 again I trade the risk levels not Market
00:14:37.839 Cycle Theory but
00:14:41.279 listen let's go through an exercise
00:14:44.680 where we take this as the top and not
00:14:48.560 this it seems absurd right it absolutely
00:14:51.600 seems absurd and one of the reasons it
00:14:53.600 seems absurd is because at the end of
00:14:56.160 the day price action is King right who
00:14:57.800 the hell cares what indicators are
00:14:59.839 saying price action is King right so 69k
00:15:05.120 was the top right it wasn't 64k it was
00:15:09.320 69k and so you could argue that why why
00:15:12.480 measure it any differently you know this
00:15:14.399 bare Market in 2022 looked the same as
00:15:17.199 the 2018 bare market and it looked the
00:15:19.079 same as the 2014 bare Market in fact if
00:15:21.959 you look at year-to dat Roi of
00:15:25.880 Bitcoin in bare Market years 2014 2018
00:15:30.120 2022 they look nearly identical in fact
00:15:33.639 you know how we've averaged out prior
00:15:36.399 having years to give us an idea as to
00:15:38.279 where Bitcoin might end this year right
00:15:40.279 we've done that before we looked at the
00:15:41.720 average 2012 2016 and 2020 and then we
00:15:44.319 just overlay it with Bitcoin in 2024 and
00:15:46.920 remarkably it's still tracking
00:15:49.480 it one of the things and also by the way
00:15:53.560 Bitcoin has been tracking just what it
00:15:55.399 did in 2023 right remarkably right it's
00:15:58.319 just tracking what it did in 2023 and
00:16:02.199 so what I think is interesting is if you
00:16:04.959 average out 2014 and
00:16:08.759 2018 it basically told you exactly what
00:16:11.440 was going to happen in 2022 right
00:16:13.319 exactly where the price of Bitcoin would
00:16:15.319 end up at the end of the bare Market
00:16:16.839 year you see
00:16:18.880 that I think that's interesting but I
00:16:21.199 really think that that was fairly
00:16:22.560 interesting that it it it ended the year
00:16:24.480 sort of the average of the last two
00:16:27.199 midterm years so sometimes just
00:16:29.199 averaging this stuff out works out quite
00:16:31.120 well but what if we were to look at it
00:16:35.199 in the way that I just mentioned where
00:16:37.240 instead of taking November as the top
00:16:40.120 which is dubious absolutely dubious to
00:16:42.240 not just take November as the top
00:16:44.360 especially when it looks very similar
00:16:45.959 right when you go look at at the
00:16:48.160 ROI uh from the low it looks like we're
00:16:52.120 on track like we always are in fact if
00:16:53.800 you measure if you look at this cycle
00:16:55.920 compared to two cycles ago how can you
00:16:59.040 not see the similarities right it's
00:17:02.120 nearly
00:17:03.360 identical
00:17:06.160 right look at Roi after cycle Peak so if
00:17:09.720 you look at the ROI after cycle Peak and
00:17:12.160 you go Peak to Peak we're actually still
00:17:14.919 tracking last cycle right now right this
00:17:17.599 is basically as measured from the peak
00:17:19.199 bitcoin's up the same amount it was at
00:17:21.079 this point last cycle as crazy as that
00:17:23.760 seems if you compare it to two cycles
00:17:27.039 ago it's actually still quite ahead of
00:17:30.240 where it was two cycles ago if you take
00:17:35.000 November as the
00:17:37.799 top but if you take April as the top and
00:17:42.919 not November then you're all of a sudden
00:17:46.720 right you're about 6 months further
00:17:48.360 along right and so we can do that switch
00:17:50.919 it to April now you see the change
00:17:54.400 here look at the uh structure of
00:17:57.640 this he here the low you there was a low
00:18:01.159 in June and then a slightly lower low in
00:18:02.760 November if you take it as measured from
00:18:05.000 April even this little move right here
00:18:07.799 looks the same right this the sort of
00:18:09.440 the dead cat bounce you guys remember
00:18:11.679 when we were talking about that dead cat
00:18:13.360 bounce off the 50 we moving
00:18:15.559 average in uh you know two cycles
00:18:21.960 ago right here right you guys remember
00:18:24.559 that dead cat bounce
00:18:28.960 kind of looks like the same thing right
00:18:30.520 it's just that it somehow met it somehow
00:18:32.600 went to a new all-time high right so
00:18:35.039 look at that the deadcat bounce in 2021
00:18:39.400 led to a new high but it it almost
00:18:42.120 perfectly matches the dead cat Bounce
00:18:44.440 from the cycle before and then they
00:18:46.240 rolled over together and then there was
00:18:48.720 this low around the same time right you
00:18:52.320 see
00:18:53.120 that and then there was another low way
00:18:56.320 over
00:18:57.120 here and then the the Cycles started to
00:18:59.760 move up together now if you look at it
00:19:02.799 this way you could argue that we're
00:19:05.360 actually much further
00:19:07.600 along than we might actually believe we
00:19:10.440 are because it's only reasonable to
00:19:13.919 assume that Bitcoin could top when it
00:19:15.880 always does right in Q4 of the post
00:19:19.840 having year Q4 so December November
00:19:24.159 October even though it's never I don't
00:19:25.760 think it's ever actually peaked in
00:19:26.640 October but Q4 of 2025 or sometime
00:19:29.880 around that I mean it could be a little
00:19:30.840 bit earlier could be you know July
00:19:33.320 August September right A lot of people
00:19:35.280 are calling for that as well um if you
00:19:38.120 measure it like this what does it tell
00:19:42.280 you well if you measure it like this and
00:19:45.080 you go Peak to
00:19:46.640 Peak right you look at at the last two
00:19:49.799 peaks last
00:19:51.880 cycle would have only
00:19:55.360 lasted if you if again if you're taking
00:19:57.400 April as a top it only lasted uh what
00:20:00.480 was that 1214
00:20:02.840 days two cycles ago it lasted 1473
00:20:08.600 days and the current cycle is already at
00:20:13.240 1344 days so if we're already at
00:20:18.360 1344 and last cycle went out to
00:20:22.919 1473 that doesn't get you as far
00:20:26.640 out as you might believe
00:20:29.200 if you were just measuring it as
00:20:31.280 November as the
00:20:33.159 top right so you can see there is you
00:20:37.280 know there is in fact a a a clear
00:20:39.240 difference right between whe whether you
00:20:41.559 measure it as you know from April or if
00:20:45.000 you measure it from November so what do
00:20:48.520 we have here right we have one
00:20:51.760 option
00:20:53.520 is a right translated Peak right or
00:20:58.360 right translated cycle I guess where you
00:21:01.320 get it in Q4 of
00:21:04.039 2025
00:21:06.720 okay you could argue that you get a
00:21:10.600 right translated cycle that comes a
00:21:13.880 little bit earlier than that right
00:21:16.320 sometime in
00:21:18.760 2025 uh let's say the second half of
00:21:22.960 20125 either of those I think would just
00:21:26.320 be considered a right translated cycle
00:21:30.799 whether it comes in Q4 or just sometime
00:21:33.840 in the second half of 2025 right it
00:21:35.559 could be Q3 as well that would be a
00:21:38.279 normal cycle and it would also
00:21:40.720 potentially set the market up for its
00:21:43.279 typical midterm year bare market right
00:21:47.880 and that would be
00:21:49.600 2026 seems like an outcome Tock and it
00:21:53.360 seems like a likely outcome
00:21:56.200 right the other View
00:21:59.279 is you get a left translated cycle where
00:22:03.400 you get a peak as early as
00:22:07.080 Q4 of 2024 or q1 of
00:22:12.559 2025 this is not going to be as popular
00:22:16.919 of a view right it's not going to be as
00:22:18.880 popular of a view but it's at least
00:22:20.799 something we should consider right it's
00:22:22.760 not something to take to the bank and
00:22:24.240 ask them to cash it in because they're
00:22:25.559 just going to roll their eyes but it's
00:22:27.520 something to at least consider consider
00:22:29.159 and the only reason I mention it is
00:22:31.400 because there are some elements that you
00:22:34.440 could argue kind of line up for
00:22:36.559 something like that especially if you
00:22:38.480 measure it Peak to Peak especially if
00:22:41.400 you measure it Peak to Peak and you
00:22:43.080 measure it from the April top instead of
00:22:45.159 the November top the other thing that I
00:22:47.400 wanted to
00:22:48.320 mention is there's a couple there's a
00:22:50.480 couple of cases in the past that look a
00:22:53.200 little similar to it and that would be
00:22:56.520 sort of two examples right one example
00:22:58.159 is the QQQ and we've talked a little bit
00:22:59.960 about the QQQ the QQQ launched in 1999
00:23:04.480 and it launched in March and and when it
00:23:06.880 launched you can see that after
00:23:09.120 launching it launched it hit a low of
00:23:11.640 around 48 Bitcoin when the ETF launched
00:23:14.480 hit a high at a local high of around 48k
00:23:17.320 so it makes the comparison really easy
00:23:19.200 they both launched around the time that
00:23:21.000 the asset that they're following was at
00:23:22.640 48 right so the QQQ 48 Bitcoin 48k the
00:23:27.799 QQQ
00:23:29.039 had a drop in early August and had a
00:23:32.799 higher low in mid October doesn't that
00:23:36.279 sound familiar right in in Bitcoin
00:23:39.120 remember it launched the QQ or sorry the
00:23:42.440 the when the spot ETF launched for
00:23:44.039 Bitcoin it launched here at 48k and then
00:23:47.400 it had a low in early August right and
00:23:50.760 then a higher low in mid October early
00:23:53.320 to mid October and furthermore what's
00:23:56.480 really spooky and almost feels like a
00:23:59.120 simulation to some degree the QQQ broke
00:24:05.159 100 here that week right there February
00:24:08.760 7th when the QQQ launched it took 48
00:24:13.279 weeks to break through 100 48 weeks if
00:24:17.720 you go look at Bitcoin how many weeks
00:24:20.320 would you care to guess it took to break
00:24:22.400 through 100k from when the ETF
00:24:26.120 launched it took 47 weeks almost
00:24:31.200 identical number of weeks 47 weeks for
00:24:34.000 Bitcoin to break through 100K 48 weeks
00:24:36.760 for the QQQ to break through
00:24:40.880 100 almost identical but the QQQ did not
00:24:46.360 top at 100 in fact it continued to go up
00:24:51.320 for 54
00:24:53.279 weeks from when the ETF launched now
00:24:56.200 what's remarkable about that is that 54
00:24:59.760 weeks after bitcoin's ETF launched would
00:25:03.480 actually occur would correspond to
00:25:06.159 election day or sorry not election day
00:25:08.440 Inauguration Day January 20th the day
00:25:11.679 that Garett ginzler resigns and so again
00:25:15.120 I'm not asking for it to be your base
00:25:17.159 case but I I don't want people to go
00:25:19.320 into it assuming they know when the
00:25:21.559 cycle peak's going to be because I have
00:25:23.159 to imagine that when the QQQ topped in
00:25:26.600 March of the election year it probably
00:25:29.360 took a lot of people off guard right it
00:25:31.440 probably took a lot of people off guard
00:25:34.039 and and and kind of surprised them but
00:25:36.760 here's the
00:25:38.360 thing even if that does end up being a
00:25:41.760 top for
00:25:43.120 Bitcoin the market didn't know it until
00:25:45.799 half a year later let me show you what I
00:25:48.120 mean when the QQQ hit this level it went
00:25:51.600 all the way up to
00:25:53.080 120 right 120 so for Bitcoin that would
00:25:56.760 be about 120k what's interesting is if
00:25:59.760 you measure out year-to-date Roi for
00:26:03.080 Bitcoin in 2024 and you average out just
00:26:06.640 prior having Years 2012 2016 and 2020
00:26:10.200 they average out to be about 3x from the
00:26:12.600 yearly open well 3x from the yearly open
00:26:15.080 for Bitcoin is about
00:26:16.880 120k right so it seems kind of similar
00:26:19.600 that doesn't mean that Bitcoin has to
00:26:20.720 stop at 120 exactly there are some
00:26:23.679 differences between the launch of the
00:26:25.120 ETF for Bitcoin and the QQQ right when
00:26:27.440 when the QQQ launched 48 was the low
00:26:31.159 when bitcoin's ETF launched it was sort
00:26:33.120 of a surge into a high and then the low
00:26:35.720 ended up being 38 not 48 right the low
00:26:39.080 was 38 and that's one of the things I'd
00:26:41.159 like to mention the volatility for
00:26:43.039 Bitcoin has been a little bit different
00:26:44.559 right so for for Bitcoin the low was 38
00:26:48.159 after the launch for the QQQ the low was
00:26:52.320 48 the August low was 57 for the QQQ but
00:26:57.840 for Bitcoin the August low was
00:27:01.799 49 okay the March high was 73 whereas
00:27:06.919 over here the the marchapril high was
00:27:10.279 only 56 so it's not an exact comparison
00:27:13.520 so the extremes can be different right
00:27:15.520 it could go higher or you know the
00:27:18.000 volatility could in fact be different
00:27:20.279 but what's interesting is that the QQQ a
00:27:23.320 year later went to 120 and then it got a
00:27:26.120 massive selloff back to 63
00:27:29.440 think about that 120 to 63 in about 3 to
00:27:33.840 4 weeks about 1 month or so just to give
00:27:37.760 you an idea of what that would look like
00:27:40.000 for Bitcoin um and again I I don't even
00:27:42.679 know that this is the most likely
00:27:43.799 scenario but it would basically look
00:27:46.240 like retesting that trend line there
00:27:48.679 sometime in 2025 because the QQQ got
00:27:51.799 that correction a year about 54 weeks
00:27:54.760 after the launch of the ETF it finally
00:27:57.480 had a larger correction and that
00:27:59.840 correction ended up being about almost a
00:28:02.480 50% drop right so if Bitcoin were to go
00:28:07.039 to
00:28:08.240 120k or thereabouts and then get a 50%
00:28:12.279 drop I mean it would basically put you
00:28:13.720 at retesting that trend line that it
00:28:15.559 broke out from so here's the thing
00:28:17.480 though when it when the QQQ did that no
00:28:20.760 one knew that that was the end right I I
00:28:23.039 have to imagine a lot of people were
00:28:24.480 still fairly bullish because there was a
00:28:26.640 low put in in in April but then there
00:28:30.000 was just a higher low put in in May and
00:28:31.799 then another higher low in July now
00:28:35.080 remember for Bitcoin throughout the last
00:28:37.679 couple of years when Bitcoin put in
00:28:39.760 these higher
00:28:41.480 lows it occurred in Q3 right Q3 there
00:28:45.799 and then Q3 right here right this was
00:28:48.399 July this was August so if it were to
00:28:50.799 follow something like that it would
00:28:52.559 still look like a fairly normal
00:28:55.480 cycle even as far out as September of
00:28:58.960 2025 it could just then resolve to a
00:29:01.760 lower
00:29:03.120 high and then go down in Q4 2025 rather
00:29:07.480 than up okay so that's at least another
00:29:12.600 Cycle Theory to at least be aware of not
00:29:16.679 saying it's the base case I would say it
00:29:19.279 could turn into the base case if you get
00:29:21.080 a big drop like this sometime out in
00:29:23.080 2025 here's the thing though normally
00:29:26.159 Bitcoin gets a correction
00:29:28.679 in q1 in January of the post year so
00:29:31.880 that's what I would be looking towards
00:29:33.120 to figure out is it a normal cycle or is
00:29:36.840 it a left translated cycle because in a
00:29:39.159 normal cycle Bitcoin would get a January
00:29:42.720 correction of about 30 to 40% it got one
00:29:45.880 January 2021 it also got one in January
00:29:49.559 of
00:29:50.440 2017 if you go look at January
00:29:53.039 2017 um right here Bitcoin got about a
00:29:56.519 30 to 40% drop so I would argue this I
00:29:59.799 would argue that whenever this sort of
00:30:01.600 this maybe January drop or potentially
00:30:03.760 February January February it whenever
00:30:06.000 that drop occurs like historically it
00:30:08.519 has does it result in say a 30% drop
00:30:12.880 maybe a 40% drop where potentially it
00:30:15.360 just finds support at the bull market
00:30:17.080 support band
00:30:19.600 right you can see that it it has
00:30:21.840 historically found some support there at
00:30:23.399 the first time it tests it does it find
00:30:26.279 support at that level
00:30:28.720 if it does then there's a good chance
00:30:31.159 that Bitcoin just continues its normal
00:30:33.399 cycle with topping in Q4 of
00:30:37.159 2025 if it's a larger drop like a 50%
00:30:41.240 drop where it comes all the way back
00:30:43.039 down to retest this trend line that
00:30:45.960 could be a little bit more concerning
00:30:47.600 and then thus make you question whether
00:30:49.480 it's a normal cycle or if something
00:30:51.679 different is in fact
00:30:54.440 happening there's one other comparison
00:30:56.639 as well that I I think is worthwhile to
00:30:58.840 mention and that's not just the QQQ
00:31:01.360 because that's just sort of one launch
00:31:03.000 and you know you you could also look at
00:31:04.679 the Gold ETF launch and say that it
00:31:06.440 stayed in a bull market for years so why
00:31:08.559 can't Bitcoin just follow that but if
00:31:10.440 you look at at the S&P 500 we know this
00:31:13.559 has been an inflationary cycle and so I
00:31:15.440 think the best thing to do is to go back
00:31:17.600 to the last period where we had sort of
00:31:19.559 some inflationary times and that was all
00:31:21.480 the way over here in the 1970s so if you
00:31:24.200 overlay the US inflation rate year
00:31:26.519 over-year one of the things you'll
00:31:28.240 notice is that in the
00:31:30.480 1970s the market also bottomed out in
00:31:33.600 October right you see these bottoms uh
00:31:36.519 by by the S&P right or sort of like you
00:31:39.360 know in in in the midterm year right
00:31:41.360 this is 1962 so you have 1962
00:31:45.320 1966 1970 right same thing as today
00:31:49.240 right I mean the fouryear cycle is still
00:31:50.919 was still well alive back then as well
00:31:52.760 where the market tends to show a lot of
00:31:54.320 weakness in the midterm year 1966
00:32:00.760 1970 and 1962 and also 1974 right every
00:32:05.880 midterm year we saw the S&P stuck in
00:32:09.639 traffic on struggle Street back then and
00:32:12.279 arguably it was because of these
00:32:14.200 inflationary impulses that the market
00:32:16.320 was having to deal with but what's
00:32:18.559 really fascinating about these tops is
00:32:21.639 that they were not your typical right
00:32:24.519 translated cycle tops right remember the
00:32:28.080 right translated cycle means it tops
00:32:30.679 only about a year before the bare Market
00:32:32.919 low these tops occurred two years
00:32:36.519 approximately before the bare Market low
00:32:38.720 and they occurred in January this one
00:32:42.200 occurred in January of the inauguration
00:32:46.399 year right I mean it it it occurred in
00:32:48.799 the post having year in January and the
00:32:51.480 cycle before that it occurred in
00:32:54.000 December November December right so
00:32:59.440 this is what a normal right translated
00:33:01.279 cycle would look like right where the
00:33:03.000 market trends
00:33:05.320 up for three
00:33:07.639 years and then drops for one or so but
00:33:13.000 this is what a left translated cycle
00:33:15.279 would look like where it only goes up
00:33:16.480 for two years and then drops for two
00:33:19.240 years do you see the difference rate
00:33:21.200 where it goes up for two and then drops
00:33:23.639 for two rather than go up for
00:33:26.399 three and drop for one so this is why
00:33:30.799 this whole Cycle Theory stuff is
00:33:32.519 important and it's important to
00:33:34.320 recognize what has happened in history
00:33:36.519 not to say that it's going to repeat
00:33:37.960 that but just to say that look it's
00:33:40.279 something to keep on your radar now
00:33:41.720 right now I am not that a you I'm not as
00:33:45.080 concerned about another inflationary
00:33:47.360 impulse one of the reasons for that is
00:33:49.760 if you look at the unemployment rate
00:33:51.440 back then when you did get the secondary
00:33:55.080 inflation impulse right where inflation
00:33:57.919 really started to go back up it was
00:34:00.600 while the unemployment rate was going
00:34:02.440 down right so inflation was going up
00:34:04.559 unemployment was going down here again
00:34:06.799 unemployment was going down inflation
00:34:08.719 was going up but we're not seeing that
00:34:10.800 this time right we're seeing the the you
00:34:13.760 know inflation's going down and the
00:34:16.199 unemployment rate's going up right so
00:34:18.440 it's it's a little bit different than
00:34:19.760 the 1970s it's the unemployment rate
00:34:21.918 that's going up right now not inflation
00:34:24.560 I mean inflation's gone up a little bit
00:34:26.040 recently uh but it's not you know it's
00:34:28.359 not as it's not looking exactly like
00:34:29.839 what it looked like back then in fact if
00:34:30.918 you look uh if you go check out uh
00:34:33.719 inflation year-over-year
00:34:35.440 what you'll notice is that back then it
00:34:38.199 bottomed out in the summer of the
00:34:41.320 election year right just below 3% and
00:34:43.839 then it started to slowly Trend back up
00:34:45.679 but it wasn't until just before you got
00:34:47.760 a big move in inflation like a 1% jump
00:34:50.960 in a month that the market really
00:34:52.320 started to struggle again so here you
00:34:54.560 know initially though while inflation
00:34:56.480 was going back up right initially while
00:34:58.960 it was going back up uh the market
00:35:00.920 didn't care right the market was going
00:35:02.160 up too but once you got a bigger move up
00:35:04.800 that was when the market sold off here
00:35:06.400 you're starting to see inflation go up a
00:35:07.920 little bit Market doesn't care right
00:35:09.920 because it's still not a big move up in
00:35:12.040 either the inflation rate or the
00:35:13.960 unemployment rate right it's been
00:35:15.359 relatively tame so I would keep an eye
00:35:18.000 on that as well you know do you get a
00:35:20.280 repeat of the 1970s doesn't really seem
00:35:22.760 like this time is exactly the same thing
00:35:24.160 with the unemployment rate trending up
00:35:25.640 whereas back then it was trending down
00:35:27.440 but is at least something to consider as
00:35:30.440 an outcome that you know could happen uh
00:35:33.400 next year so sort of recap here we have
00:35:37.560 a typical cycle right we have a typical
00:35:41.200 cycle a right translated cycle with a
00:35:44.440 peak in Q4 of 2025 this is what would
00:35:47.440 happen if history repeats itself
00:35:49.520 perfectly again if it's a little bit
00:35:52.119 different it could be say like in the
00:35:54.240 just the second half of 2025 maybe it
00:35:56.040 comes as early as July August September
00:35:58.760 I know a lot of people have been
00:35:59.680 throwing out July August September as
00:36:02.359 another likely outcome so we're putting
00:36:04.599 that up there as well it's important you
00:36:06.160 know when you do a literature review if
00:36:07.800 you're if you're going to study a topic
00:36:09.160 right you know when I went to grad
00:36:10.079 school if you're going to study a topic
00:36:11.040 you do a literature review you see what
00:36:12.640 what are people calling for right what
00:36:13.839 are people saying and and then you know
00:36:15.760 talk about that because those people
00:36:17.319 could very well be right and then you
00:36:19.000 look at also a um uh sorry this is a a
00:36:24.079 sorry right translated cycle um right
00:36:27.760 translated cycle and then so number
00:36:29.240 three would be sort of a left translated
00:36:30.720 cycle where you get a peak as early as
00:36:33.280 as Q4 2024 SL q1 of 2025 right that is
00:36:39.079 an option not a popular option but it is
00:36:42.800 it is an option to at least consider and
00:36:45.520 and you can kind of see like the
00:36:47.079 evidence for all these different
00:36:48.599 outcomes right you can you can see the
00:36:50.440 evidence for a peak and Q4 of the post
00:36:53.640 having year right I mean like why why
00:36:55.319 over complicate things especially when
00:36:57.359 the cycle Roi as measured from the low
00:37:01.000 you know just looks like this right why
00:37:02.800 over complicate
00:37:05.200 things it's just doing the same thing it
00:37:07.200 always does but so what if there's a
00:37:08.560 correction in January so what you could
00:37:11.280 argue that a correction in January 304
00:37:13.560 30 to 40% correction in January would
00:37:15.839 actually be quite healthy if it's more
00:37:18.079 than that right if it's a 50% correction
00:37:20.839 that would maybe imply that the music is
00:37:23.480 starting to stop but if it's just a 30
00:37:25.119 to 40% correction the Market's just
00:37:26.680 doing what it always does
00:37:28.400 um so in this case I would say you know
00:37:31.000 if it's not broke don't fix it if the
00:37:32.960 Market's falling what it always does why
00:37:34.680 over complicate things obviously there's
00:37:37.200 reasons to assume that it could play out
00:37:40.040 somewhat differently right and and those
00:37:42.119 reasons are not just looking at the S&P
00:37:44.599 and the unemployment rate and inflation
00:37:46.440 but obviously you know talking about
00:37:48.680 sort of the elephant in the room right
00:37:50.200 and that's just the uh the the yield
00:37:52.079 curve right the yield curve you go look
00:37:53.599 at at treasury y spreads um and you look
00:37:56.599 at the unversioned process of 3-month
00:37:58.359 and 10e yield it is happening right now
00:38:00.760 right you can see that the
00:38:04.359 uninversity now and
00:38:07.480 historically that's when you get
00:38:09.119 recessions but here's the trick though
00:38:11.160 just because you get it uninverted does
00:38:12.680 not mean it it does not always mean
00:38:14.000 recession now sometimes it means
00:38:15.720 recession later right for instance in in
00:38:17.480 2007 the yield curve the three-month and
00:38:19.800 10e yield uninverted in May but you
00:38:21.800 didn't get a recession until November so
00:38:24.119 about half a year later the cycle before
00:38:26.359 that the Y curve un inverted in January
00:38:29.359 the recession was only about 2 months
00:38:30.839 later but in 1980 to 1989 the Y curve
00:38:33.839 uninverted
00:38:34.839 and and it took a year right it un it
00:38:37.520 first uninverted sort of like August of
00:38:39.079 89 or so but you didn't get a recession
00:38:41.280 until July or so of 1990 so even when
00:38:44.599 you see that process play out it doesn't
00:38:47.680 always mean the recession is immediate
00:38:49.560 even if you get one it could still be a
00:38:51.960 year away in fact there's one example in
00:38:55.000 the 1960s where you had an inverted
00:38:56.960 yield curve in 1967 it uninverted but
00:38:59.960 you still didn't get a recession for 2
00:39:03.359 years right and back then though even
00:39:06.720 though the recession was two years away
00:39:08.560 the market actually topped in December
00:39:11.720 of the election year right and that was
00:39:13.720 sort of a a a left translated Peak right
00:39:17.480 a left translated Peak
00:39:20.640 so if it's a normal cycle if it's a
00:39:23.359 normal cycle which is what everyone
00:39:25.160 hopes for right that's what that's what
00:39:27.440 but you know that's how you make your
00:39:28.800 the money right is if the cycle just
00:39:30.200 lasts for another year if it's a normal
00:39:32.680 cycle there's still going to be some
00:39:34.680 drops along the way historically it
00:39:36.720 would mean we get a drop in January
00:39:38.520 right that would just be a higher low if
00:39:40.599 it's a normal right translated cycle if
00:39:44.319 it's a left translated cycle then you
00:39:48.000 would need to start looking out for
00:39:49.720 potential Market cycle tops sooner but
00:39:52.800 we've talked a lot about this M Market
00:39:55.160 Cycle Theory stuff right you don't have
00:39:57.400 to ultimately know exactly when it's
00:40:00.000 going to occur to take advantage of it
00:40:01.760 whenever it does occur as I say don't
00:40:03.319 ever let a good bubble go to waste right
00:40:05.000 no one knows exactly how it's going to
00:40:06.760 play out don't let it go to waste if it
00:40:09.040 plays out at a different time frame than
00:40:10.839 what you are thinking so that's why we
00:40:12.480 talk about some of these other
00:40:13.720 indicators right like your your P Cycle
00:40:16.720 top indicator and I'm a little concerned
00:40:19.839 that you know a lot of people are are
00:40:21.200 are looking at some of these indicators
00:40:22.440 but they're not looking at sort of
00:40:23.920 what's under the surface if you divide
00:40:25.760 the moving averages you can can see the
00:40:27.839 diminishing Peaks on this right so it
00:40:30.760 you might even not see the signal flash
00:40:32.839 this time just because of those those
00:40:34.800 diminishing those diminishing Peaks
00:40:36.520 right instead of going to one which is
00:40:38.800 normally what it would need to do to
00:40:40.480 trigger this indicator it might top out
00:40:42.720 at say 0 n or so I would say about 0. n
00:40:46.480 could be a market cycle top right now
00:40:48.319 it's at 0 58 right but it's starting to
00:40:50.720 move up here right I mean just uh a
00:40:53.160 month ago it was at it was at um 0.53
00:40:57.640 now it's at 0.58 if it continues to move
00:41:00.280 up like this it's only going to take a
00:41:01.599 few months for it to get to 0. n
00:41:04.839 especially if Bitcoin continues to
00:41:06.480 accelerate to the upside like it has
00:41:08.119 been so I would look at things like that
00:41:09.920 right look at at other models right like
00:41:12.560 the stock to flow model even if you
00:41:14.240 disagree with it who cares right I mean
00:41:16.319 the the stock to flow model has
00:41:17.440 certainly been helpful but look at at at
00:41:19.720 how it gets closer to this line and now
00:41:22.440 it's spending more time below that line
00:41:23.720 so take the deflection from it and look
00:41:26.000 at the peaks look at the diminishing
00:41:27.839 Peaks and when it hits that so that is
00:41:30.359 what I think you should look at um
00:41:32.680 there's a lot of different ways to view
00:41:34.280 the market right a lot of different ways
00:41:35.720 to view the market and it it could be a
00:41:37.760 right translated Peak like normal it
00:41:39.839 could be a left translated Peak just to
00:41:41.560 throw us off course um if it ends up
00:41:45.119 being a left translated Peak then
00:41:47.680 perhaps last cycle was the warning for
00:41:50.119 it right where you got a top in April
00:41:52.680 that was basically the same top as the
00:41:54.560 one that came half a year later right so
00:41:57.280 if you know if if it were to play out
00:41:58.640 say like the QQQ did where you get a top
00:42:02.119 early on in the year in q1 and then it
00:42:05.280 drops in Q2 Q3 everyone thinks it's
00:42:07.520 going to go to a new high in Q4 and then
00:42:09.520 it ends up being a lower high right
00:42:11.440 that's what happened with the QQQ back
00:42:13.640 in the year
00:42:14.880 2000 right where it you know it
00:42:16.920 basically put in a top and then it
00:42:18.560 started to trim back up I'm sure a lot
00:42:19.839 of people were hoping for another rally
00:42:21.079 in Q4 of of the of that election year
00:42:23.640 but it ended up just being a lower high
00:42:25.720 and it ended up being a less translated
00:42:29.559 cycle in the short term though obviously
00:42:32.400 you know momentum has certainly been on
00:42:34.119 bitcoin side again year-to-date Roi is
00:42:37.079 still just tracking what it did last
00:42:38.720 year again if it's not broke don't fix
00:42:40.559 it and and it's also tracking the
00:42:44.400 average of Prior having years
00:42:49.000 right so you know if Bitcoin gets up to
00:42:52.280 like 120 130 140 or something and we're
00:42:55.680 looking at these indicators and it looks
00:42:57.400 like those diminishing Peaks are hitting
00:42:59.119 and the wrist metric is screaming you
00:43:00.599 know this is the time then it's possible
00:43:03.559 you could get a peak sooner the other
00:43:05.040 thing to look at that I think is is kind
00:43:06.960 of interesting is is just looking at
00:43:08.559 something as simple as the RSI but on
00:43:10.640 longer time frames now the weekly RSI
00:43:12.960 there the twoe RSI is one of the things
00:43:15.400 that helped us identify the midcycle top
00:43:17.720 earlier this year it wasn't I mean the
00:43:19.640 RSI was more so used for Confluence it
00:43:21.640 was mainly because gold was breaking out
00:43:23.240 and that's what marked the midcycle top
00:43:24.720 last time uh but if you look at the twoe
00:43:26.720 RSI you can see that it's essentially
00:43:28.640 putting in these lower highs and it's
00:43:30.319 also putting in lower
00:43:32.200 lows and you might notice that it
00:43:34.680 already tag this trend line but I said I
00:43:37.319 didn't think that was the market cycle
00:43:38.680 top but it looks a lot like 2013 right
00:43:41.720 where you get sort of an early top you
00:43:44.800 get a
00:43:46.000 low right you get this low right
00:43:49.920 here and then it goes back up and puts
00:43:52.240 in another top but if it does if 2024 is
00:43:56.079 just repeating what 2013 did then you
00:43:58.960 could be sort of seeing things
00:44:00.720 accelerated by a year but what I would
00:44:04.280 look at more so than the two-e RSI is
00:44:07.680 the monthly RSI right take a look at the
00:44:09.960 monthly RSI the monthly RSI also shows
00:44:13.440 these diminishing Peaks and lower lows
00:44:17.000 right so if at some point this cycle
00:44:21.119 we're all sitting here and we're looking
00:44:22.640 at the monthly rsis at 90 or something
00:44:25.640 and the P Cycle top indicator is at the
00:44:27.960 moving average division's at 0.9 and the
00:44:30.160 risk metrics at 08 or something or 0.9
00:44:33.160 and the stock to flow deflection is at a
00:44:35.559 lower high right if everything is lining
00:44:38.319 up then it doesn't matter what month it
00:44:40.680 is doesn't matter if it's this month
00:44:43.079 January February March April May June
00:44:44.520 July August September October November
00:44:45.720 December right it doesn't matter what
00:44:47.400 month it is it's just when it
00:44:52.240 happens don't ignore it and that's I
00:44:55.359 think what a lot of people sort of you
00:44:56.920 know you know are are sort of fall
00:44:59.119 victim to is they get in their mind when
00:45:01.880 it has to happen and so they're not
00:45:04.079 willing to see it any other way and I've
00:45:05.720 fallen for that as well right I'm not
00:45:07.119 saying it as sort of like oh I'm blaming
00:45:09.599 you this is on personal experience right
00:45:12.119 you know you learn from your mistakes
00:45:13.839 you don't get married just like you
00:45:15.359 don't marry an altcoin because it's
00:45:16.640 going to take more than half in the
00:45:17.680 divorce don't marry a price prediction
00:45:21.800 top a timeline don't marry it be
00:45:24.280 open-minded to your view being right but
00:45:27.400 also say you know what if if there's a
00:45:29.520 move before then I don't want to ignore
00:45:33.000 that and if there's a move after what I
00:45:35.800 think I don't want to ignore that either
00:45:37.680 right it's like in 2021 I certainly
00:45:40.280 didn't think that 64k was the top in
00:45:42.559 April and I thought the cycle was going
00:45:44.960 to was going to last a lot
00:45:47.400 longer but I still sold I I still sold a
00:45:50.720 decent amount of Bitcoin here was like
00:45:53.880 87% right cuz it was the the rist metric
00:45:57.280 back then was at 0.95 or something
00:46:01.119 ridiculous right if you go look at
00:46:03.119 historical uh
00:46:06.599 risk on bitcoin it went to the highest
00:46:10.240 wristband in q1 of that year not over
00:46:14.319 here right so it was all about I don't
00:46:17.880 know when those Peaks are going to occur
00:46:21.200 right I don't but the great thing is you
00:46:23.040 don't have to know it's just about
00:46:25.480 whenever it does happen don't let the
00:46:27.760 bubble go to waste right and that's why
00:46:28.880 I say don't ever let a good bubble go to
00:46:30.599 waste even if it happens on a timeline
00:46:32.400 different from what you are in fact
00:46:34.720 expecting so that's sort of a a a
00:46:37.960 general thought process as to where are
00:46:41.400 we in the market cycle I think a lot of
00:46:43.480 it depends on what happens here in the
00:46:45.599 next like couple of weeks or so you know
00:46:48.040 next few weeks as Bitcoin accelerate
00:46:50.520 into into the end of the year does it
00:46:52.599 accelerate into January and February
00:46:54.720 where it's just going crazy and all the
00:46:56.240 indicators screaming this is the top or
00:46:59.280 is there is there a pullback at some
00:47:00.960 point when we least expect it right
00:47:03.280 there's always a chance that happens too
00:47:04.800 what the and there's only I can't find a
00:47:06.760 lot of evidence for that but there's one
00:47:09.040 thing to consider I mean the bank of
00:47:10.520 Japan is going to be meeting tomorrow as
00:47:12.440 well as the fed and giving us their
00:47:14.520 interest rate decision obviously it
00:47:16.119 seems like the fed's going to cut seems
00:47:17.960 like the bank in Japan's going to stay
00:47:19.480 constant but if they raise rates that
00:47:22.359 could be a a negative for risk assets
00:47:25.119 okay and it could actually help delay
00:47:27.520 the uh the overall cycle because again
00:47:30.359 if you look at at at at Bitcoin and you
00:47:32.839 were to
00:47:33.960 Overlay not us interest rates right but
00:47:36.559 if you were to Overlay interest rates
00:47:38.520 over in Japan some you guys were like
00:47:39.960 why does that matter because there's a
00:47:40.920 carry Trade A lot of people actually
00:47:42.400 borrow over there because the interest
00:47:43.920 rates are a lot cheap a lot lower the
00:47:46.040 cost of money over there is a lot lower
00:47:47.839 so you have this carry trade but you can
00:47:49.680 see right the last two times at the
00:47:52.040 bankage pen raise rates there was a
00:47:53.599 correction in the markets right a couple
00:47:55.440 of weeks later right the bankage pen
00:47:56.559 raise r rates in March and then you got
00:47:58.160 sort of an April correction they raised
00:47:59.960 rates in July and then Bitcoin got an
00:48:02.359 August correction so if they do raise
00:48:04.079 rates in December that could lead to a
00:48:06.040 January correction now the market is
00:48:07.640 suggesting they're not going to raise
00:48:08.800 rates in December tomorrow so there's a
00:48:10.720 good chance they don't raise rates
00:48:11.960 tomorrow and they delay it until January
00:48:13.880 or March the next couple of meetings but
00:48:16.040 if they do raise rates tomorrow that
00:48:18.240 could lead to a negative outcome for
00:48:20.040 risk assets um but again it doesn't
00:48:23.280 really seem like that's the most likely
00:48:24.480 outcome but I'm also not in the mind of
00:48:26.359 the people that are working over at the
00:48:28.240 bank of Japan the other thing to
00:48:29.880 consider right is if there is a pullback
00:48:32.520 in the market even if it's a sharp one
00:48:34.559 it doesn't even mean it's the it's the
00:48:36.240 cycle top and you know we were just
00:48:37.960 talking about the QQQ during the dot era
00:48:41.000 right we're just talking about that go
00:48:42.760 look at the S&P during the Doom era and
00:48:45.440 and actually look at it through the lens
00:48:46.800 of of M2 if you look at it through the
00:48:48.680 lens of M2 one of the things you'll
00:48:50.760 notice is that the S&P actually got a
00:48:53.920 correction around this point right and
00:48:56.079 and you can see to some of these lows by
00:48:58.520 the S&P this again this is the S&P
00:49:00.480 divided by M2 right you can kind of see
00:49:03.480 some of the similarities between these
00:49:05.720 these sort of these lows and these highs
00:49:08.520 um in fact right
00:49:11.119 here if you look at at sort of this low
00:49:14.319 right here in 1996 kind of corresponds
00:49:16.799 to this low here in in October 2022 and
00:49:20.000 we just made it up to where the S&P with
00:49:23.440 respect to M2 made it to in July of 19
00:49:26.760 98 right we're at that same level now so
00:49:29.880 if there is a unexpected correction just
00:49:32.720 when everyone doesn't think it's going
00:49:34.440 to happen it might feel like the Cycle's
00:49:36.880 over but there's still a chance that
00:49:40.119 it's not right and look what happened
00:49:41.480 over here in 1998 there was a big
00:49:43.839 correction by the S&P divided by M2 I I
00:49:47.280 mean it wasn't a huge correction I think
00:49:48.760 it was like a 20% drop it probably felt
00:49:51.400 like the cycle was over but then it just
00:49:54.160 accelerated again and the party went on
00:49:57.240 basically from you know from 1998
00:49:59.440 October 199 1998 until basically a year
00:50:02.440 and a half later so you have to consider
00:50:05.000 that even when it seems like things are
00:50:06.880 obvious you can get Corrections out of
00:50:08.640 nowhere now that correction occurred
00:50:10.200 during a midterm year which is when
00:50:12.200 Corrections normally occur so this is
00:50:13.960 not exactly the same thing but there's
00:50:15.880 no denying that there's some there's
00:50:18.359 something to be said about sort of these
00:50:20.240 highs against
00:50:22.480 M2 right and these lows against M2 right
00:50:26.160 the low from 1996 was the same low that
00:50:28.400 we saw in January 2019 and the same low
00:50:30.440 that we got in November 2022 and these
00:50:33.240 highs by the S&P divid M2 were the same
00:50:35.839 Fe you know February 2020 January 2022
00:50:39.280 even around July 2023 we got a pullback
00:50:41.520 and then it blasted through now it's
00:50:43.160 gone all the way up to where it was in
00:50:44.760 October of 1998 what's really
00:50:46.920 fascinating about that move by the
00:50:49.000 S&P back over here is that when when it
00:50:52.040 got this drop the FED cut rates in
00:50:54.920 response to that drop from 5 a half% to
00:50:58.680 4.75% exactly what they've done today so
00:51:01.000 far right the market interest rates
00:51:02.799 dropped right here from 5 and a half you
00:51:04.920 can see on this YX right here five and a
00:51:06.400 half down to 4.75 but it was in response
00:51:09.040 to the drop this this drop here by
00:51:11.880 interest rates has not really been in
00:51:13.880 response to a drop it's more so trying
00:51:16.559 to you know make a change before there's
00:51:21.000 a drop so it seems like it's a little
00:51:23.000 bit more sort of front running things
00:51:25.319 right the fed's trying to get ahead of
00:51:26.839 things before things start to get too
00:51:28.839 bad so that's where I think we are guys
00:51:31.040 I mean there's a lot of different ways
00:51:32.160 to view the market cycle obviously I'm
00:51:34.000 trying to come at this without a bias I
00:51:36.079 think it it's hard to do it sometimes
00:51:38.079 but look at it without a bias respect
00:51:40.359 the right translated Peak respect
00:51:42.640 there's a chance you get a left
00:51:43.799 translated Peak respect the fact that
00:51:45.960 none of us have any idea what's going to
00:51:48.160 happen but I think the best thing to do
00:51:49.920 is just react to the data as it comes in
00:51:52.000 and if you see those moves make sure you
00:51:53.839 take advantage of it and don't let it
00:51:55.160 come to pass just because you're married

# The Fed Cuts Interest Rates by 25 bps
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/EjiTJ8hlT1Q

00:00:00.680 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.240 into the
00:00:03.200 macroverse today we're going to talk
00:00:05.359 about the most recent fomc and of course
00:00:08.679 how it relates to risk assets like
00:00:11.000 Bitcoin if you guys like the content
00:00:12.880 make sure you subscribe to the channel
00:00:14.320 give the video a thumbs up and check out
00:00:16.279 the sale on intothe cryptoverse premium
00:00:18.880 at intothe cryptoverse decom we had a
00:00:21.880 pretty interesting uh meeting today with
00:00:25.320 the fomc the FED did in fact cut rates
00:00:28.560 from 4.7 5% to 4.5% so they cut 25 basis
00:00:34.600 points you can see it here on on the
00:00:37.399 chart uh interest rates have dropped
00:00:39.760 from a terminal rate this cycle of
00:00:43.160 55% now this marks uh 100 basis points
00:00:47.199 of rate cuts ever since the rate cutting
00:00:49.879 cycle began back in September but that's
00:00:53.640 not the only thing that we should talk
00:00:55.079 about because while they did continue to
00:00:57.920 cut rates um
00:01:00.840 they've also decided to continue
00:01:03.879 quantitative tightening and you can see
00:01:06.119 that here where it says the committee
00:01:09.119 will continue reducing its Holdings of
00:01:11.920 Treasury Securities and agency debt and
00:01:15.119 agency morgage back Securities so
00:01:18.960 there's this idea that at some point the
00:01:21.759 FED will begin to expand their balance
00:01:25.439 sheet again but that has not yet
00:01:28.240 happened so if you were to actually just
00:01:30.119 look at um total assets held by the
00:01:33.880 Federal Reserve you can see it's it's
00:01:35.960 mostly just been on a downtrend really
00:01:37.720 since early 2022 and last cycle you can
00:01:41.960 see that they went through a period of
00:01:44.719 quantitative tightening as well but it
00:01:47.200 didn't last nearly as long as this
00:01:51.560 Cycle's quantitative tightening and the
00:01:54.040 reason that of course we mentioned that
00:01:56.479 is because we know and again history
00:01:58.960 doesn't have to repeat itself and
00:02:00.640 there's a chance that dominance has
00:02:02.240 topped but we do know that last cycle
00:02:05.360 dominance did not actually top until QE
00:02:09.160 began and even then it it was it did
00:02:11.879 sweep the high over a year later so it's
00:02:15.200 at least something to consider as we
00:02:17.959 continue to navigate the cryptoverse try
00:02:19.879 to figure out what is the most likely
00:02:21.840 outcome to remember that it wasn't until
00:02:25.160 QE began that Bitcoin dominance really
00:02:28.120 started to durably go down and that
00:02:30.400 could Pro you know partially explain
00:02:33.040 some of the resilience by Bitcoin
00:02:35.200 dominance recently uh you know it's
00:02:37.640 continue to move back up but the thing
00:02:39.920 that I I think you should also remember
00:02:41.560 is that there was an almost identical
00:02:42.920 move last cycle by dominance where it
00:02:46.040 dropped in in you know November of the
00:02:49.519 having year which is exactly what it did
00:02:51.519 this time and then it went back up in
00:02:54.080 December of the having year and even
00:02:56.319 continued to go up up until January of
00:02:59.440 the post po having year so there's
00:03:01.000 always a narrative to accompany
00:03:03.360 everything but you could also argue that
00:03:05.640 narrative follows price price does not
00:03:08.640 follow narrative so same thing's
00:03:11.159 happening this cycle as far as dominance
00:03:13.680 is concerned so far that happened last
00:03:16.640 cycle we'll see what dominance does but
00:03:18.959 still currently at
00:03:20.959 58% so when thinking about you know
00:03:24.120 monetary policy and and how it affects
00:03:26.440 the markets you know it's also important
00:03:29.799 to look at at what's likely going to
00:03:32.000 happen next year or why are the markets
00:03:34.760 reacting in a certain way obviously the
00:03:37.120 markets have sold off quite a bit here
00:03:39.519 bitcoin's back down to 100K uh the S&P
00:03:43.040 has even dropped almost 3% today which
00:03:45.480 is actually quite a you know quite a big
00:03:47.080 drop for the S&P to drop in a single day
00:03:49.799 we don't get it that often where you see
00:03:52.200 a 3% drop in a single day and you can
00:03:55.319 see it dropped almost 3% 2.95% so rather
00:03:59.159 steep drop drop uh back down to I
00:04:02.200 suppose this support level here so we'll
00:04:04.480 see if that holds but one of the reasons
00:04:07.120 that that drop could have
00:04:09.319 occurred if you're looking for a
00:04:11.280 narrative to blame is if you go over and
00:04:14.280 look at the summary of economic
00:04:16.798 projections you will see that most
00:04:19.918 Market participants are thinking that
00:04:22.560 the fed's only going to cut twice next
00:04:24.639 year right and there's some Market
00:04:26.400 participants that think uh they won't
00:04:28.560 even cut that amount and and then
00:04:29.880 there's a few that think they'll cut
00:04:31.160 more than that but sort of the the
00:04:33.400 median number of cuts expected for next
00:04:36.440 year appears to only be two which would
00:04:39.479 get interest rates back down to 4% now
00:04:44.360 this is potentially less than what
00:04:46.240 markets were hoping for and that might
00:04:48.720 be some of the perceived weakness some
00:04:50.680 of the things that Powell said today
00:04:52.240 I'll just read off a few quotes so you
00:04:54.160 can kind of understand his mindset and
00:04:56.320 where he's coming from he says the
00:04:59.080 economy strong overall uh a broad but he
00:05:01.919 did say that a broad set of indicators
00:05:03.759 suggest that conditions of the labor
00:05:05.400 market are less tight than in 2019 and
00:05:08.240 we've obviously made a lot of
00:05:09.280 comparisons 2019 that was when we had
00:05:11.600 the last rate cutting cycle and he did
00:05:14.360 say uh that downside risks to the labor
00:05:17.680 market has diminished but he went on to
00:05:20.280 say that job creation is now well below
00:05:22.639 the level that would hold unemployment
00:05:24.319 constant the job finding rate is low and
00:05:26.919 declining in other measures measures
00:05:28.960 such as surveys of workers and
00:05:30.600 businesses quits things like that
00:05:32.520 broadly show a much cooler labor market
00:05:35.280 than we had in 2019 he still believes
00:05:39.000 that policy is meaningfully restrictive
00:05:42.080 which essentially means that he thinks
00:05:44.400 that interest rates right as they stand
00:05:46.400 right now he thinks that interest rates
00:05:48.800 are currently still above our star the
00:05:51.840 neutral rate now if you're not aware
00:05:53.400 what the neutral rate is there it's this
00:05:55.720 theoretical concept um it's like sort of
00:05:58.319 an abstract idea that suggests there
00:06:00.680 exists an interest rate at when interest
00:06:03.600 rates are at or if it's below that level
00:06:06.720 the economy should expand if if interest
00:06:09.400 rates are above that level the economy
00:06:11.720 should contract and you know it's
00:06:15.199 probably a little bit more Nuance than
00:06:16.919 that you know not everything is is based
00:06:19.440 solely on interest rates but if you do
00:06:22.000 buy into that idea poell is essentially
00:06:24.280 saying that
00:06:25.800 45% for interest rates is actually still
00:06:28.639 above the neutral rate therefore we it
00:06:31.039 should still help slow the economy down
00:06:34.240 now what he's referring to when he says
00:06:36.639 that job creation is is well below the
00:06:38.720 prior you know the pre-pandemic levels
00:06:40.720 and that people are having a hard time
00:06:42.199 finding a job what he's referring to are
00:06:45.000 all these CHS we've been going over over
00:06:46.800 here on you know we've been going over
00:06:48.319 on ITC for quite a long time right
00:06:50.039 highers are down you know and highers
00:06:52.039 have been trending down quits have been
00:06:54.160 trending down so you know that stuff has
00:06:58.080 been in a in a pretty long downtrend if
00:07:01.639 you look at the unemployment rate it's
00:07:04.919 still relatively low right and and one
00:07:07.240 of the reasons I think it's relatively
00:07:09.000 low is if you go look at reasons for
00:07:11.960 unemployment the reasons for
00:07:13.720 unemployment for job losers has been in
00:07:15.639 a fairly controlled uptrend right it
00:07:17.840 doesn't look parabolic the angle of
00:07:19.680 attack isn't the same as what we saw
00:07:21.960 during prior recessions one of the main
00:07:24.199 reasons the unemployment rate has gone
00:07:25.479 up is just new entrance to the labor
00:07:27.199 force right that arguably has been going
00:07:29.599 parabolic suggesting that it's a lot
00:07:31.680 it's actually quite difficult for people
00:07:33.199 to find a job if they don't currently
00:07:35.680 have one but because layoffs are still
00:07:38.240 low if you have a job there's a good
00:07:40.680 chance you've been able to keep it now
00:07:42.160 obviously that doesn't apply to everyone
00:07:43.560 and you know you got you don't want to
00:07:45.039 be insensitive about that sort of stuff
00:07:46.720 but layoffs if you look at them right if
00:07:49.720 we just look at them objectively go over
00:07:51.639 to layoffs and discharges they've
00:07:53.560 actually been relatively low and on
00:07:55.520 average they've been lower than where
00:07:57.440 they were pre pandemic so
00:08:00.319 You could argue that the markets have
00:08:02.319 still done relatively well despite a
00:08:04.360 slowly un you know slowly increasing
00:08:06.680 unemployment rate because the main
00:08:09.199 reason the unemployment rate is going up
00:08:11.759 potentially is just due to an expanding
00:08:13.360 labor force rather than layoffs now
00:08:16.159 where it could theoretically become a
00:08:17.720 problem is if you do get layoffs right
00:08:20.240 because if you get layoffs and people
00:08:22.400 aren't hiring that's what leads to the
00:08:26.000 acceleration of the unemployment rate
00:08:28.840 right so if you know if the unemployment
00:08:30.800 R's already going up and layoffs are
00:08:33.880 low if layoffs start to pick up and
00:08:37.120 hiring is low that's how you see the
00:08:40.120 unemployment rate go up a lot quicker
00:08:42.719 and that's what can lead to sort of
00:08:44.839 panic in the markets right those those
00:08:47.160 are when the the recessions actually
00:08:48.560 occur so it's important to follow this
00:08:51.000 stuff even though it might be somewhat
00:08:52.839 dry and boring to listen
00:08:55.480 to he did go on to say uh that you know
00:08:59.480 said that we are at a point where it
00:09:00.680 makes sense to slow the pace of rate
00:09:03.240 Cuts he says there's also there's no
00:09:05.360 reason to think a downturn is any more
00:09:07.160 likely than it usually is and he also
00:09:09.800 said I think it's pretty clear that
00:09:11.800 we've avoided a recession I do find it
00:09:15.160 somewhat interesting not because he's
00:09:17.120 wrong per se I mean obviously the
00:09:19.079 markets you know we haven't really seen
00:09:20.880 a recession uh despite a lot of people
00:09:23.399 calling for it only a couple years ago
00:09:26.000 but one of the things you have to
00:09:27.279 remember is that as he says monetary
00:09:29.880 policy operates with long and variable
00:09:31.680 lags right so just because you haven't
00:09:33.640 seen one yet doesn't mean you won't
00:09:35.800 right you could have one still ahead um
00:09:38.600 and we've actually seen some recessions
00:09:41.079 occur right around the time that a new
00:09:44.079 president takes office in fact we saw
00:09:46.000 one in
00:09:47.399 1981 when when you know Reagan you know
00:09:50.560 when when Reagan began that term um if
00:09:53.959 you go if you go zoom in over here you
00:09:55.560 can see what I'm talking about right so
00:09:57.320 here's December of 1980 the market kind
00:10:00.000 of topped out for a little bit went down
00:10:03.000 uh for a little while and then
00:10:04.880 ultimately trended uh back up but I mean
00:10:08.000 you you can see what I'm what I'm
00:10:09.320 talking about right so December 1980 and
00:10:11.279 then you get into 1981 Market went down
00:10:14.279 for a little while and then started to
00:10:16.680 go you know to grow to to to grow again
00:10:19.279 but it does go to show that you really
00:10:22.120 can't discount anything you know when it
00:10:25.160 comes to mon you know when it comes sort
00:10:26.560 of the macro stuff and and I think the
00:10:28.560 other thing with hard with macro stuff
00:10:30.600 is it takes so long to play out by the
00:10:33.480 time certain ideas do play out most
00:10:35.880 people have given up on those ideas um
00:10:38.680 now what what we try to do over here is
00:10:40.440 we try to acknowledge these long-term
00:10:42.320 ideas but remind people that they will
00:10:44.720 likely take years and years to play out
00:10:47.360 so while there's a good chance we do
00:10:49.519 eventually get a recession I don't
00:10:51.120 really think it's you know the
00:10:53.279 overwhelming favorite of a scenario
00:10:56.000 until you see initial claims come in at
00:10:58.279 around 300 ,000 right right now they're
00:11:00.360 at
00:11:01.320 242,000 as long as they're down here
00:11:04.000 it's still relatively low once you see
00:11:06.040 them above 300K that's probably when it
00:11:09.240 becomes somewhat problematic but we
00:11:11.680 haven't seen that yet right we haven't
00:11:13.279 seen that yet and there's not ex you
00:11:14.680 know there's no telling exactly when
00:11:16.040 that's going to happen of course it
00:11:18.600 makes sense to go look at at treasury
00:11:20.800 yield spreads because we are starting to
00:11:22.560 see the UN inversion of the yield curve
00:11:25.079 right so it's interesting because there
00:11:26.800 have been plenty of times in history
00:11:28.880 where the un inversion of the Y curve
00:11:30.880 did you know precede a recession but as
00:11:33.519 I've said previously while sometimes you
00:11:35.920 had a recession within a month or two
00:11:38.040 other times the recession didn't occur
00:11:40.040 for six to 12 months later um and in one
00:11:42.839 case in 1967 it didn't occur until two
00:11:45.519 years later so I I find it interesting
00:11:49.160 that that pal does say that you know he
00:11:51.760 says he think it's pretty clear that
00:11:52.880 we've avoided one I would agree that we
00:11:55.160 have avoided one in 2023 and we've
00:11:57.040 avoided one it looks like potentially in
00:11:58.560 2024
00:12:00.120 um but you know what will history
00:12:02.519 remember this as will it will it just
00:12:04.160 kind of look like this eventually where
00:12:06.320 you get one just as everyone's kind of
00:12:09.000 giving up on the on the idea so at least
00:12:11.200 something to keep in mind uh for 2025
00:12:13.680 and and potentially 2026 as that yield
00:12:16.560 curve un inverts and remember one of the
00:12:18.399 things about yield curve un inversion is
00:12:20.839 that sometimes it could uninverted then
00:12:23.560 reinert right just because you see
00:12:25.000 theinverseside
00:12:29.720 you know fed policy and and one of the
00:12:31.480 things that I've mentioned as well is uh
00:12:34.519 the 10-year yield right if you go look
00:12:36.360 at the 10-year yield it it's kind of had
00:12:39.360 an interesting movement interesting
00:12:41.240 movement recently and not one that we
00:12:43.199 didn't anticipate I said when the FED
00:12:45.639 starts cutting in September we were
00:12:47.600 likely going to see the dollar rally
00:12:49.079 until the end of the year and that's
00:12:50.600 basically what's happened right the do
00:12:52.360 the dollar was down at 100 now it's at
00:12:54.480 108 I'm guessing it's going to Rally
00:12:56.240 into the end of the year potentially
00:12:57.800 find a top sometime at early January is
00:13:00.800 my best guess on the dollar but the
00:13:02.240 reason I say that is because the dollar
00:13:04.399 and the long end of the yo curve have
00:13:05.880 been fairly highly correlated for quite
00:13:07.639 some time and you can see that the long
00:13:09.959 of the Y curve right the 10-year yield
00:13:11.920 is now bouncing now the reason why this
00:13:13.720 is important is when you look at at sort
00:13:16.240 of what's Happening Here with the 10year
00:13:18.480 yield depending on how you want to draw
00:13:20.320 this right but you can kind of see that
00:13:22.320 it might be repeating kind of what it
00:13:24.600 did a little over a year ago where it
00:13:27.160 had sort of these tops and then it
00:13:29.480 eventually broke out and then came back
00:13:31.720 down to sort of retest where it broke
00:13:33.480 out from you can kind of see the same
00:13:35.519 thing happening right here where it then
00:13:37.560 eventually broke out and then it went
00:13:40.240 back down to sort of retest where it
00:13:41.720 broke out from now again this is a
00:13:43.160 little bit more of a dubious trend line
00:13:45.120 I'm not really sure it's the exact same
00:13:46.920 thing but you could argue that there's
00:13:49.199 some similarities there and remember if
00:13:51.519 the long end is breaking out here to go
00:13:53.959 higher then um if you look at what
00:13:56.800 happened last time that this happened
00:13:58.519 the S&P did at least go down for a few
00:14:00.920 weeks before then continuing its you
00:14:03.519 know overall trend back up so do be
00:14:06.560 aware that could happen and also
00:14:08.839 furthermore when you look at assets like
00:14:11.320 TLT uh often times not always but often
00:14:14.680 times they do find sort of macro double
00:14:17.839 bottoms okay so if you look at like sort
00:14:19.560 of the weekly uh for for something like
00:14:22.000 TLT remember TLT is inversely correlated
00:14:24.759 to um to the long of the Y curve right
00:14:27.639 so if the long of the Y curve goes up TT
00:14:29.440 goes down and so I guess the argument is
00:14:32.680 is it possible for TLT to come back down
00:14:34.920 here where it was in October of 20123
00:14:37.560 and there is it doesn't have to right
00:14:39.399 but there is some precedent for TLT sort
00:14:42.320 of finding a macro double bottom um you
00:14:45.600 know or even sweeping that low uh before
00:14:48.720 you know before making another move back
00:14:51.440 to the upside so I I would at least keep
00:14:53.120 an eye on that and you could you could
00:14:54.199 have a double bottom just right here but
00:14:56.959 I wouldn't be that surprised if you saw
00:14:58.680 it down here once again especially with
00:15:00.440 the FED cutting and and it could be the
00:15:02.720 it could be a way of saying that it's
00:15:04.440 not recessionary right the fact that the
00:15:06.440 long the curve is going up you could
00:15:08.880 argue that the long end of the Y curve
00:15:11.079 is doing what the FED is unwilling to do
00:15:13.199 and that is to stay higher for longer
00:15:15.360 and I'm not saying they haven't stayed
00:15:16.639 higher for longer at all but this is
00:15:19.560 very abnormal right the long end of the
00:15:21.480 O curve does not normally go up this
00:15:23.720 much after the feds after the FED starts
00:15:26.120 cutting rates and one potential
00:15:28.120 explanation
00:15:29.519 for the long of the Y of going up
00:15:31.360 following rate Cuts is that the market
00:15:34.000 is starting to price back in
00:15:36.160 inflationary concerns right so if you go
00:15:39.000 look um if you go look over here at at
00:15:44.360 inflation year-over-year it has started
00:15:47.480 to go up a little bit recently I mean
00:15:49.800 it's not that concerning just yet but
00:15:52.120 remember it started off slow in the
00:15:53.880 1970s as well and then in the post
00:15:57.120 election year right so the post having
00:15:59.440 year for for us djones uh it started to
00:16:02.279 really go up and that's what led to a
00:16:04.079 broader Market correction but one of the
00:16:06.959 things that you should note is back then
00:16:09.199 when inflation did start to go back up
00:16:11.680 it was when the unemployment rate
00:16:14.040 started to go back down right so if you
00:16:16.720 look at at say here's the here's the
00:16:19.600 unemployment
00:16:22.639 rate here and if you
00:16:26.240 overlay inflation
00:16:30.199 you'll notice that back in the
00:16:32.079 1970s right back in the 1970s when when
00:16:36.279 unemployment started to go down that was
00:16:38.959 when inflation started to accelerate
00:16:40.560 again and and the same thing later on
00:16:42.160 the 1970s right but now you're seeing
00:16:43.759 kind of the opposite where inflation's
00:16:45.800 going down but the unemployment rate is
00:16:47.440 going up Powell actually did address
00:16:49.600 this he
00:16:51.160 said and I
00:16:54.000 quote let me see if I can find it um he
00:16:58.160 said the labor market Market is not a
00:16:59.519 source of significant inflationary
00:17:02.120 pressures and I agree with them I mean
00:17:03.880 the unemployment rate is Turing up not
00:17:05.880 tring down in the 1970s the unemployment
00:17:08.160 rate was trending down and that led to
00:17:12.079 you know more waves of inflation but you
00:17:14.520 could argue that with the unemployment
00:17:16.760 rate trending up this would not be a
00:17:20.000 significant portion of of you know
00:17:23.160 future inflation now if you see the
00:17:24.679 unemployment rate start to go down again
00:17:26.760 then the narrative might change and it I
00:17:28.240 mean it probably will at some point but
00:17:30.039 we haven't seen that yet right we've
00:17:31.360 seen the unemployment rate go up we've
00:17:33.160 seen inflation come down and and now the
00:17:35.799 question is is you know something's got
00:17:38.039 to give right either inflation needs to
00:17:40.200 keep coming down to to the 2% Target
00:17:44.720 because if it doesn't it just means the
00:17:46.799 fed's going to have to stay restrictive
00:17:48.320 even longer which is going to make the
00:17:50.400 you know which would likely make the the
00:17:52.280 labor market loosen up even more sending
00:17:55.000 the unemployment rate higher so you know
00:17:57.640 certainly a lot of things to consider
00:17:58.840 consider with what Pal's talking about
00:18:00.760 again with quantitative tightening
00:18:02.600 continuing it could explain uh why you
00:18:06.360 know why a lot of these altcoins are
00:18:08.520 stuck in traffic on struggle street
00:18:10.039 today and it also could help explain why
00:18:12.400 Bitcoin dominance is up you know I've
00:18:14.480 said many times that dominance was going
00:18:16.360 to go to 60% this cycle and it has but
00:18:19.440 that doesn't mean that it can't bounce
00:18:20.640 around there and it's always possible it
00:18:22.039 goes higher I would watch the bull
00:18:23.840 market support band for Bitcoin
00:18:25.280 dominance because you can see it's
00:18:26.559 trying to get back above it and it is
00:18:28.080 above it right now let's see if it gets
00:18:29.840 a weekly close I would also keep an eye
00:18:32.000 on on dominance excluding stable coins
00:18:34.480 because you know it's been in this wedge
00:18:37.280 uh for you know for a very long time and
00:18:41.440 it's actually looks like it's trying to
00:18:42.600 break back into the wedge right now so
00:18:45.240 you know if it's able to get back in it
00:18:47.440 then that could certainly change the
00:18:48.840 narrative on dominance in 2025 but
00:18:50.840 there's also a good chance that it just
00:18:52.360 gets rejected by the bull market support
00:18:54.080 band and goes down in 2025 but in the
00:18:56.120 short term I think the reason why all
00:18:58.840 coins are are struggling especially on
00:19:00.760 their Bitcoin pairs is just simply
00:19:02.760 because QT continues and last cycle all
00:19:07.600 all Bitcoin pairs struggled until QT
00:19:11.280 ended now not only did they say that
00:19:14.480 that it's continuing but they gave no
00:19:16.960 clear insight as to when it's going to
00:19:18.720 stop either right they just say that the
00:19:21.480 committee will carefully assess incoming
00:19:22.919 data but that they're going to continue
00:19:25.320 to reduce their Holdings of Treasury
00:19:27.520 Securities and agency debt an agency
00:19:29.960 mortgaged back
00:19:32.400 Securities so um it's interesting
00:19:36.600 because you know I think a lot of times
00:19:37.679 the market participants want to really
00:19:39.159 kind of front run the Fed but then they
00:19:41.440 do and then the FED has to stay
00:19:43.520 restricted for even longer because
00:19:45.320 Market participants keep trying to front
00:19:46.720 run things so it could just be a game of
00:19:50.360 of of chicken right to figure out who
00:19:52.440 who's kind of who's going to fold first
00:19:54.600 but certainly interesting thing and you
00:19:56.320 know if you look at all Bitcoin pairs
00:19:58.159 actually this is kind of an interesting
00:20:00.000 level for them because they actually
00:20:01.880 also got a move to that exact same level
00:20:04.640 a couple of times in the past right they
00:20:06.360 got a move back to this level in June of
00:20:08.520 2019 and also they got to move to that
00:20:10.640 same level in August of 2017 so we'll
00:20:14.280 see what happens here my guess is if
00:20:16.159 they're going to bounce they they won't
00:20:18.440 bounce until the bull market support ban
00:20:20.559 right which is back to say 04 to 041
00:20:23.799 okay that St they're going to bounce
00:20:25.320 it's probably not till then and there is
00:20:27.679 still a non negligible chance that they
00:20:29.840 do eventually return to the range lows I
00:20:32.200 know it might not be the most likely
00:20:33.400 outcome for a lot of people uh but
00:20:35.600 remember even in November of the even in
00:20:38.080 October of the post having year in 2017
00:20:40.320 they were at the range lows so they
00:20:42.440 could eventually find themselves there
00:20:44.000 once again even though Bitcoin dominance
00:20:46.280 did in fact go to 60% already now
00:20:50.240 obviously Bitcoin took a hit today in
00:20:52.159 the grand scheme of things I mean you
00:20:53.960 know this is what the weekly candles
00:20:55.360 look like so it's kind of hard to even
00:20:58.280 notice this like you know the correction
00:21:00.840 but if it does evolve into something
00:21:02.640 more uh just note there is some
00:21:04.559 precedent for it I mean we we saw
00:21:06.280 something similar happened uh with some
00:21:08.200 of the cryptocurrencies back in 2016
00:21:10.679 when the dollar rallied uh the long of
00:21:12.799 the Y curve rallied we also saw allcoins
00:21:14.960 kind of struggle until the post post
00:21:17.600 having year right until 2025 so this is
00:21:20.159 what happens a lot of December of having
00:21:22.039 years right like everyone kind of gets a
00:21:23.799 little excited from from all front
00:21:26.120 running things in November and then in
00:21:28.120 December people think that alts are
00:21:30.120 going to continue to run and then they
00:21:31.840 just kind of stall out and potentially
00:21:33.880 not make the move that people want them
00:21:35.320 to make until sometime in the post
00:21:37.240 having year this would not be the first
00:21:38.720 time this has happened um and it could
00:21:41.520 just simply be due to things like the
00:21:43.240 dollar continuing to go up right the
00:21:44.960 dollar goes up Bitcoin dominance
00:21:46.760 normally follows it I mean you can even
00:21:48.279 overlay Bitcoin dominance and see what
00:21:49.799 I'm talking
00:21:51.120 about right normally normally when when
00:21:54.960 when you know the dollar starts to get
00:21:56.760 these rallies right Bitcoin dominance
00:22:00.120 can can start to accelerate back up to
00:22:02.159 the upside and you're kind of seeing
00:22:03.840 something like that potentially start to
00:22:05.240 happen here as it as it's continuing to
00:22:07.760 go up Perhaps Perhaps Market pres can no
00:22:10.200 longer ignore it and and exactly what
00:22:12.360 happened in late 2016 could potentially
00:22:14.240 happen again where altcoins struggle and
00:22:17.200 then they start to do well again after
00:22:18.760 the dollar tops out now remember the
00:22:20.240 dollar did not top out in
00:22:22.600 2016 I I actually believe it was early
00:22:25.520 2017 uh when the dollar topped out you
00:22:28.120 can see there it topped out yeah
00:22:29.520 basically the first week of January so
00:22:31.880 I'm arguing that the dollar is currently
00:22:34.600 in this move right here right sort of
00:22:36.600 the last move uh that it's going to get
00:22:38.960 for a while and I'm thinking it might go
00:22:40.559 up to 109 110 something like that it
00:22:43.360 could go higher but that's kind of what
00:22:45.520 I'm thinking if you look at a fib
00:22:46.840 retracement uh on this you can kind of
00:22:48.919 see that it's topped out around the 0.5
00:22:50.480 FIB a couple of times now it's moving
00:22:52.480 higher the one the 618 would put you at
00:22:55.000 109 the 786 would put you all the way up
00:22:57.640 at at 111
00:22:59.240 right and remember the prior high is all
00:23:01.120 the way back up near near
00:23:03.039 115 um so we'll see what the dollar does
00:23:05.760 but my guess is it will remain strong
00:23:08.000 until sometime early 2025 the other
00:23:11.200 thing that'll be interesting to watch
00:23:12.279 for and I don't think they've made the
00:23:13.480 decision just yet will be the bank of
00:23:15.720 Japan right because the bank of Japan is
00:23:17.640 likely going to keep rates constant if
00:23:20.039 they do raise rates that would be
00:23:21.799 probably a very negative outcome for
00:23:24.000 risk assets right if they do raise rates
00:23:25.760 and the reason is because the carry the
00:23:28.080 carry trade would have to get unwounded
00:23:30.200 even more and the carry trade
00:23:31.240 essentially is just you know looking at
00:23:33.240 the difference between um or it's
00:23:35.720 basically just people you know uh going
00:23:38.880 over you know going over there to get
00:23:40.919 cheap money because it's easier to do so
00:23:42.679 over there than do so over here and if
00:23:44.760 if the Gap if the spread between
00:23:46.360 interest rates in the United States and
00:23:47.679 Japan Narrows then that carry trade gets
00:23:49.799 Unwound and you can kind of see what I'm
00:23:51.480 talking about right as you can see pre
00:23:53.799 prior times where the difference between
00:23:55.960 interest rates in the United States and
00:23:57.440 Japan uh started to drop uh it it can
00:24:01.120 sometimes lead to negative economic
00:24:02.880 outcomes as you can see the green shaded
00:24:05.440 region now I think people look at this
00:24:07.080 like oh it has to happen immediately I
00:24:08.960 mean think about this ever since this
00:24:10.200 has been dropping Bitcoin essentially
00:24:12.159 went from like um you know what like 50k
00:24:17.159 all the way up to 100K right so you
00:24:19.320 might say well this is not this has not
00:24:20.960 worked this time but this is one of
00:24:22.240 those things where like it takes years
00:24:24.720 to play out I think a lot of people just
00:24:26.840 lack uh sometimes the patience to see it
00:24:29.320 play out it doesn't mean you shouldn't
00:24:30.279 be an investor it doesn't mean that you
00:24:31.559 shouldn't take risk or anything like
00:24:33.039 that it just means it's something you
00:24:34.360 should be aware of that could eventually
00:24:35.960 play out and how do you want to navigate
00:24:38.240 such an environment if it does play out
00:24:40.480 the same way it has previously so we are
00:24:43.679 going to likely see the continued
00:24:46.480 normalization of the yield curve um as
00:24:49.960 as the short end continues to go down
00:24:52.080 because the fed's cutting and the longin
00:24:54.000 continues to go up right so you can even
00:24:55.480 see the yield curve is almost completely
00:24:57.720 normalized
00:24:58.880 from a you know basically a completely
00:25:00.679 inverted yield curve not that long ago
00:25:03.159 right this is what the yield curve
00:25:04.080 looked like about a year ago and then
00:25:06.799 now this is what it looks like today so
00:25:08.200 the the yield curve is normalizing it's
00:25:10.480 it's starting to look a little bit
00:25:11.919 healthier uh and we'll see you know
00:25:14.039 we'll see what happens I guess in in
00:25:16.320 2025 and and we'll try to follow this
00:25:18.000 stuff I provide you Outlook you know
00:25:20.559 provide these Outlook videos on the
00:25:21.919 macro stuff about once or twice a month
00:25:24.279 right when the when the inflation data
00:25:25.799 and the macro data the inflation data
00:25:27.679 and the labor market data comes out and
00:25:30.440 also you know whenever there is in fact
00:25:32.840 uh an fomc meeting so that's where we
00:25:35.720 are guys that's where we stand with the
00:25:37.279 markets uh let's go check in on bitcoin
00:25:40.320 one last time so right now it's at
00:25:42.000 around
00:25:43.240 101k um so I mean again like if you
00:25:46.039 think about it like
00:25:47.559 this if you look at it on the line chart
00:25:50.919 it you know you wouldn't even know you
00:25:52.159 wouldn't even know anything has happened
00:25:54.480 obviously because it just went to 108
00:25:56.520 with it all the way back down to 101 of
00:25:58.880 you that has people feeling some type of
00:26:01.159 way uh about that but I wouldn't be I I
00:26:05.559 mean I really wouldn't be that surprised
00:26:07.200 to see dominance kind of hold on uh for
00:26:10.440 for the next few weeks you know and
00:26:12.399 maybe even maybe even go up a little bit
00:26:14.080 more for the next few weeks but sometime
00:26:16.039 in 2025 I do anticipate all Bitcoin
00:26:18.720 pairs going up I think that the concern
00:26:21.880 though is you know will they in fact
00:26:23.399 have to wait until QE returns to go up
00:26:26.320 because we just haven't seen that yet
00:26:27.679 right we haven't QE return yet therefore
00:26:30.360 there's some level of justification uh
00:26:33.159 that you know that Bitcoin could still
00:26:35.880 outperform the collective altcoin Market
00:26:38.440 even if it doesn't seem like the most
00:26:39.880 likely outcome at the current time but
00:26:41.559 anyways guys we're going to go and wrap
00:26:42.559 it up there I do appreciate you guys

# Cardano: Dubious Speculation
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/6K6BoRC9Xjc

00:00:00.760 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.320 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.839 to talk about cardano and its native
00:00:06.720 token Ada dubious speculation if you
00:00:10.280 guys like the content make sure you
00:00:11.840 subscribe to the channel give the video
00:00:13.160 a thumbs up and also check out the sale
00:00:15.160 on into the cryptoverse premium at
00:00:17.680 intothe cryptoverse decom let's go ahead
00:00:20.439 and jump in so it's been a little while
00:00:22.760 since we did a video on
00:00:24.680 cardano we actually did one a few weeks
00:00:26.679 ago but I wanted to follow up on the
00:00:29.519 idea
00:00:30.679 that we presented in that video right so
00:00:34.120 essentially what we talked about was Ada
00:00:37.200 kind of repeating this pattern right
00:00:39.520 where you have this wedge and I said
00:00:43.320 that if it you know continues to track
00:00:45.960 you would likely get a sizable pullback
00:00:48.960 kind of either in December or
00:00:53.000 January back to the prior highs from the
00:00:57.000 previous year so let's follow up with
00:00:59.600 that because you know at the time Ada
00:01:01.239 was at a buck 20 and it was a little
00:01:05.360 hectic a little crazy you know the fomo
00:01:08.080 was was was running and you know I I
00:01:10.560 always prefer times like this because
00:01:12.119 you can actually sort of think a little
00:01:14.040 bit easier people a little bit more
00:01:16.439 rational um so let's go take a look at
00:01:18.880 at what's happened so
00:01:20.560 Ada if we sort of draw that same thing
00:01:23.040 out onto the
00:01:24.400 chart a has
00:01:28.439 essentially it's in the like I guess
00:01:30.880 ascending broadening wedge maybe and I
00:01:32.960 don't even know if technically that's
00:01:34.000 what it is because it did sort of break
00:01:35.799 down right here um but the pattern that
00:01:39.079 I want to talk about is where ad gets
00:01:43.040 this
00:01:44.600 move sort of like a one two move see
00:01:47.520 that one two and when it did it last
00:01:53.240 year it pulled
00:01:55.880 back
00:01:57.399 to just below that
00:02:01.119 high now ultimately it did go a lot
00:02:04.000 further down but the first pullback was
00:02:07.680 right there
00:02:10.000 okay now if you go back to last cycle
00:02:15.160 there's actually a really similar thing
00:02:16.800 that happened right where you kind of
00:02:20.280 have a similar type of of wedge it's a
00:02:23.480 little uh a little dubious to draw it
00:02:26.400 like that but just bear with me but what
00:02:29.200 you'll notice is that there was also
00:02:31.440 sort of this top here a one two
00:02:35.120 top came back down to the bottom of the
00:02:37.879 wedge went below it kind of like it did
00:02:40.720 over here
00:02:41.840 right and then went back up and then
00:02:45.840 here and I'm not saying it's going to
00:02:48.000 play out like this but I I want to go
00:02:49.440 through the the outlook here what
00:02:52.040 happened is that ADA had a larger
00:02:55.239 pullback and it actually pulled back
00:02:58.319 here where it it actually went below the
00:03:01.080 prior highs from the prior year but it
00:03:05.440 kind of it just kind of stopped right
00:03:07.920 there okay so if you look at it over
00:03:11.879 here one of the things I suggested if
00:03:14.280 you guys go back and watch the
00:03:16.920 video is that at the very least we would
00:03:19.440 see a retrace back down to the prior
00:03:23.040 high right 80 okay now it already went
00:03:26.720 to 76 cents so it's already made made a
00:03:30.360 sizable drop and if it repeats last
00:03:34.120 year it's always possible that's it
00:03:37.200 right with that said you know if it also
00:03:40.280 repeats last year you can see the drop
00:03:42.159 lasted many weeks like it wasn't just
00:03:44.519 sort of like a one drop type of thing it
00:03:47.360 actually lasted a few weeks before then
00:03:49.239 moving back
00:03:50.400 up and if you take last cycle as any
00:03:55.599 comparison then what you'll notice is
00:03:58.680 that it it it dropped further down into
00:04:02.439 it right where you kind of dropped not
00:04:06.400 it it didn't go like below this low but
00:04:09.720 it did go kind of like in here right now
00:04:13.640 if it were to go that low uh that would
00:04:16.759 be a little bit lower than where we are
00:04:18.440 right now right I mean it's possible
00:04:20.238 that it continues to drop into the end
00:04:22.120 of the
00:04:22.960 year in fact um this drop I mean it it
00:04:27.160 occurred in a having year right I mean
00:04:28.880 it occurred in in in August September uh
00:04:31.680 so it's not exactly the same timing but
00:04:34.000 you can kind of see what I'm talking
00:04:35.759 about now the other way to look at this
00:04:38.199 though is to say what if this is not
00:04:41.160 where we are but instead we just came up
00:04:44.160 to this point right because this point
00:04:47.039 right here occurred in early December of
00:04:49.400 the Bitcoin having year and right here
00:04:52.080 it occurred in late November of the
00:04:54.960 Bitcoin having year it then pulled back
00:04:58.639 when it had its pull back back it then
00:05:00.960 pulled
00:05:02.639 back not to the prior yearly high but a
00:05:06.400 little bit a little bit higher than that
00:05:09.400 so you could try to make that argument
00:05:12.080 right that it's here and not
00:05:16.759 here I think you know I think that I
00:05:21.360 mean with with where things are right
00:05:23.240 now right I mean it seems likely that
00:05:26.240 Bitcoin dominance is going to go up for
00:05:28.960 at least the next two to three weeks
00:05:31.000 it's kind of my base case right now at
00:05:32.880 least the next two to three weeks and
00:05:34.520 the reason I say that a few reasons one
00:05:37.600 one reason is that
00:05:40.360 Bitcoin um did the same thing last cycle
00:05:43.520 right I mean uh dominance did the same
00:05:45.000 exact thing last cycle if you go look at
00:05:46.880 at Bitcoin dominance it also kind of had
00:05:49.600 this like fake out where it dropped in
00:05:52.680 November and then it had like a final
00:05:54.919 surge in late December and early January
00:05:58.199 you can even you could even say take a
00:06:00.960 bar pattern here and identify what I'm
00:06:03.720 talking about right where if you take
00:06:05.919 this and you overlay it you can kind of
00:06:08.360 see a a very similar drop by dominance
00:06:11.880 in November of last cycle of the having
00:06:14.240 year and then got one final surge in the
00:06:16.560 late December early January and then
00:06:18.919 dominance fell in the post having
00:06:22.400 year so that's something to be aware of
00:06:26.560 now the reason why that's important is
00:06:29.319 you know obviously most people watching
00:06:31.520 are probably going to care about the USD
00:06:33.599 evaluation but really you should more so
00:06:36.360 care about its Bitcoin valuation than
00:06:38.360 the USD evaluation I think what's
00:06:40.759 essentially happening and I and and and
00:06:43.560 maybe you can understand where I'm
00:06:44.960 coming from and I I don't I don't expect
00:06:47.000 everyone to agree with this
00:06:48.960 but what I kind of think is happening is
00:06:52.199 that ADA is chasing whatever the most
00:06:55.360 recent narrative is okay and it's not
00:06:57.759 just Ada the reason I do a lot of analys
00:06:59.840 on Ada in this case is because it
00:07:02.479 actually behaves in a lot more of a
00:07:05.360 predictable fashion I have found than
00:07:07.400 than some of the other altcoins it's
00:07:08.479 kind of like middle of the road where
00:07:10.160 it's not you know it's not going
00:07:12.199 absolutely crazy uh at at certain parts
00:07:14.960 of the cycle and then having to drop a
00:07:16.680 lot more later on but it's also not
00:07:18.919 giving you the worst returns it's kind
00:07:20.639 of in between right it's kind of in
00:07:22.800 between
00:07:24.599 and what's interesting about it is
00:07:29.639 it kind of chases every single narrative
00:07:32.599 right in terms of like you know what's
00:07:34.560 going on in crypto but also what's going
00:07:35.759 on in the macro right so down here in
00:07:37.080 late 20122 it was sort of like all right
00:07:39.080 we're heading towards a recession and
00:07:40.680 then it was just kidding we're not let's
00:07:43.400 head towards an expansion and then you
00:07:46.199 know summer of 2023 it was like oh just
00:07:48.440 kidding back to recession back to not
00:07:50.479 recession back to recession and it kind
00:07:52.720 of keeps going back and forth and I
00:07:54.800 think the reason why it isn't yet
00:07:58.039 breaking out I either way whether it be
00:08:00.759 to the downside or the upside I think
00:08:03.759 the reason is because there hasn't there
00:08:06.800 hasn't really been a compelling reason
00:08:08.080 to believe that either narrative is true
00:08:09.919 just yet right I mean it's basically
00:08:13.280 like it's it's basically like um every
00:08:17.159 time we get down here initial claims in
00:08:20.360 the market macro side are still low
00:08:23.199 right so it's like well markets need a
00:08:25.000 reason to go down not a reason to go up
00:08:27.159 so you get this sort of this time basic
00:08:29.560 capitulation but then when they get up
00:08:31.120 here a is looking for a reason to break
00:08:33.200 out and it keeps not breaking out right
00:08:36.039 it keeps not breaking out it had a very
00:08:37.880 similar pattern last cycle where
00:08:39.760 eventually it did break out right it did
00:08:42.279 eventually break out and and obviously
00:08:45.120 the rest is history eventually it took a
00:08:48.519 long time for it to break out it didn't
00:08:50.760 it didn't really break out until January
00:08:52.720 of the post having
00:08:54.399 year but it did eventually break out but
00:08:57.200 I think the reason
00:08:59.600 it it hasn't broken out yet is because
00:09:03.480 you know Bitcoin
00:09:05.279 dominance it hasn't necessarily topped
00:09:08.560 it's possible that it has but you know
00:09:11.279 when you get JP coming out and saying
00:09:13.640 hey guys no QE for you you know the DG
00:09:17.079 can go complain about it somewhere else
00:09:19.120 and cry in the corner no no QE for you
00:09:22.880 and so if you if you overlay here total
00:09:25.760 assets held by the Federal
00:09:27.839 Reserve you'll see that you know they
00:09:30.959 were expanding their balance sheet quite
00:09:33.000 aggressively when Ada did break out of
00:09:36.200 this wedge right you can see that pretty
00:09:38.200 clearly and it was getting rejected from
00:09:40.959 this wedge while you had quantitative
00:09:44.200 tightening do you see what I'm talking
00:09:46.079 about so essentially what you're seeing
00:09:49.120 is you know Ada is wanting QE to return
00:09:54.440 but it just keeps not returning right
00:09:56.640 and and Powell keeps saying not yet
00:10:00.200 and when he says that when he says not
00:10:02.440 yet aah then gets these rejections last
00:10:05.760 cycle we only had this pattern once
00:10:09.720 right this time it's been going on a lot
00:10:11.880 longer but arguably because QT
00:10:15.120 quantitative tightening ended a lot
00:10:16.839 sooner last cycle right here it never
00:10:20.399 really ended it's still going
00:10:23.120 on and Ada didn't break out here until
00:10:27.399 after QE came back
00:10:30.079 and we don't know yet when QE is going
00:10:32.120 to come back so I think that is arguably
00:10:36.360 the consideration to make now this
00:10:40.120 though does not have a
00:10:43.000 clear correspondence to Ada USD when QE
00:10:46.720 began right it was just kind of down
00:10:48.880 here it wasn't really doing anything
00:10:50.120 special but that was when QE began now
00:10:52.519 look at Ada
00:10:54.399 Bitcoin which is what you should be
00:10:56.240 looking
00:10:57.560 at when Q
00:11:00.160 began last cycle that was around the
00:11:02.839 time that ADA USD bottomed or sorry that
00:11:05.720 was when Ada a Bitcoin bottomed at a
00:11:08.040 Bitcoin bottomed when QE
00:11:12.760 returned and that's the reason right
00:11:15.160 that's the reason why you could argue
00:11:18.240 that adaa Bitcoin has had such a sharp
00:11:20.120 correction recently is because you know
00:11:22.920 there's no guarantee as much as we want
00:11:24.920 QB to return just hasn't yet you know
00:11:27.839 when I told you guys back over here in
00:11:30.720 in 2021 2022 that ADA was going to go to
00:11:32.920 400 sets a lot of people didn't believe
00:11:35.000 me and and and and they you know they
00:11:37.720 they really dislike that view but again
00:11:39.839 it wasn't based on what I necessarily
00:11:42.279 wanted to happen it was more so based on
00:11:45.279 what I saw happen last cycle right I was
00:11:47.800 a product of my own experience and if
00:11:50.800 quantitative tightening continuing made
00:11:53.160 a a Bitcoin go
00:11:55.760 down that's why I thought hey it's
00:11:58.920 possible that it just simply goes back
00:12:00.399 to 400 stats now it went to
00:12:03.240 470
00:12:04.800 470 that's pretty close to 400 right I
00:12:08.079 mean it's in the 4 to 500 sat range
00:12:10.680 which is arguably close enough right it
00:12:13.160 is arguably close enough but there is a
00:12:15.800 case to be made there's always a chance
00:12:18.120 that it you know it puts in say like a
00:12:19.920 macro higher low it could put in a a
00:12:23.720 double bottom it could even sweep the
00:12:26.440 low if dominance is going to go up even
00:12:28.639 more right and and that's kind of the
00:12:31.079 thing to consider here is that if Ada to
00:12:34.000 bitcoin were to sweep the
00:12:37.279 low it would be due to the fact that all
00:12:40.480 Bitcoin pairs don't are unable to escape
00:12:43.800 this reality of the you know sort of the
00:12:47.240 oscillators at best reality right so if
00:12:50.360 they can't escape that reality then
00:12:53.360 obviously you know it's always possible
00:12:55.480 that ADA Bitcoin gets you know one final
00:12:59.440 drop could be a higher low could be a
00:13:02.040 lower low could be a double bottom but
00:13:04.560 just remember when all Bitcoin pairs got
00:13:07.519 this collapse this was at the very end
00:13:10.519 of the having year right this was
00:13:12.199 December going into early January right
00:13:15.399 so if you got a Drop Like That by all
00:13:19.160 Bitcoin pairs now you can see that it
00:13:22.680 would actually take you to the range low
00:13:25.600 it would take you to the range low if
00:13:27.639 you got something like that
00:13:32.199 and I I kind of like you know it's sort
00:13:33.720 of this like internal debate of like
00:13:35.920 does it have to happen like is this time
00:13:37.800 different and and there are examples
00:13:40.600 where an altcoin doesn't always go to
00:13:43.120 the range low so it's possible that the
00:13:45.600 collective altcoin Market doesn't go to
00:13:47.360 the range low the only reason I'm even
00:13:49.199 giving that consideration is because
00:13:50.680 Bitcoin dominance already went to to 60%
00:13:54.160 but like an example would be xrp Bitcoin
00:13:56.839 right xrp Bitcoin was a great examp
00:13:59.120 example from the last cycle and I don't
00:14:00.880 care if you don't like the coin I'm not
00:14:02.320 asking you to like it I'm just saying
00:14:03.759 like look at the example there are times
00:14:06.759 where you kind of have a range low this
00:14:09.240 is xrp Bitcoin last cycle you have sort
00:14:11.279 of a range a range low and a range high
00:14:14.839 but last cycle xrp Bitcoin didn't really
00:14:17.680 go all the way down to the range low but
00:14:20.199 because it didn't go all the way down to
00:14:21.720 the range low it also never went back up
00:14:24.240 to the Range High right so it's almost
00:14:26.639 one of those things where like
00:14:29.320 okay fine if it doesn't go to the range
00:14:31.800 low then so be it right so be it for I'm
00:14:36.560 talking about eight a Bitcoin right if
00:14:37.839 it doesn't go to the range low then so
00:14:39.519 be it but you run the risk of repeating
00:14:43.360 what xrp Bitcoin did where it then
00:14:45.680 doesn't go back up to the Range High
00:14:47.399 right and and I I I think that's kind of
00:14:49.399 a an Outlook an outcome that you kind of
00:14:52.320 have to be comfortable with right I mean
00:14:54.320 and and to me I I you know again I have
00:14:56.800 this sort of this like internal debate
00:14:58.320 I'm like well you know 470 SATs is
00:15:02.160 essentially 400 SATs right like why do
00:15:04.480 we got a nickel and dime why do we got a
00:15:06.839 nickel and dime this stuff uh because I
00:15:09.160 mean the grand scheme of things it looks
00:15:11.399 pretty close right it looks pretty close
00:15:16.240 but I suppose the Counterpoint would be
00:15:20.480 to go back and look at something like
00:15:22.199 xrp Bitcoin and say well you know
00:15:25.199 technically speaking last cycle xrp
00:15:28.360 Bitcoin had a really nice rally in
00:15:31.440 November of the having year it rallied
00:15:33.240 about 170% and then it still went on to
00:15:35.839 put in a lower low right it dropped 85%
00:15:38.759 after 170% rally now eight of Bitcoin I
00:15:42.240 believe went up more than that this
00:15:44.800 cycle I believe um when it had that that
00:15:47.759 little rally right there um it it's
00:15:50.040 about the same a little bit more about
00:15:51.959 194% but I mean again like the xrp
00:15:54.199 Bitcoin valuation kind of shows you what
00:15:56.399 is possible sometimes you can get those
00:15:57.920 rallies and then it could come back down
00:16:00.000 and then the other thing to at least
00:16:02.160 consider is that last year right last
00:16:05.720 year we actually got a a high by Ada of
00:16:09.720 Bitcoin in December and then it just
00:16:12.160 kind of faded from there and I'm not I'm
00:16:14.480 not showing you that to like scare you
00:16:16.920 or to FUD or anything like that it's
00:16:19.440 just like that's what happened and I I
00:16:21.040 don't control what happens right I'm
00:16:22.399 just showing you guys what happened and
00:16:24.360 when I look at a chart like this you
00:16:26.680 know I I do wonder the thing about last
00:16:29.120 cycle was that you got this nice you
00:16:31.959 know bottom in the market where it held
00:16:34.560 support for months we never really got
00:16:37.399 that for Ada Bitcoin this cycle I'm not
00:16:39.440 saying you have to have it there are
00:16:41.759 times where it doesn't play out like
00:16:44.440 that right if you look at e Bitcoin in
00:16:46.800 2016 you never really had a double
00:16:49.000 bottom right you just had a low and then
00:16:50.480 a higher low and that was it you know um
00:16:55.040 so I don't want to you know make it seem
00:16:57.360 like it has to play out like that but if
00:17:01.600 if sometime next year we're looking at
00:17:03.639 this and it just ends up playing out
00:17:05.319 like this where it kind of does that and
00:17:06.720 then comes down here to 400 STS and then
00:17:09.599 late next year starts going up into 2026
00:17:13.199 just know that it's not entirely unheard
00:17:15.520 of in fact the major spike from Ada
00:17:19.079 Bitcoin in the 2016 2017 cycle didn't
00:17:23.199 even occur until almost 2018 right it
00:17:26.880 was at the very end of 201 17 the very
00:17:30.480 end of 2017 so there does exist a
00:17:33.960 scenario where this just ends up being a
00:17:38.200 lower high for a little while on Ada
00:17:40.640 Bitcoin and perhaps the reason why we
00:17:44.200 haven't yet seen this low kind of the
00:17:47.480 structure here is because the FED never
00:17:51.600 began
00:17:54.600 QE that could be the reason right it
00:17:56.960 could just be that the FED never began
00:17:59.200 QE and so you know again it doesn't mean
00:18:02.000 that you can't make money on alts right
00:18:03.440 I mean I said is a good chance to
00:18:05.799 diversify into altcoins when Bitcoin
00:18:07.840 dominantes at 60% and a lot of alts went
00:18:09.520 up several 100% since then including Ada
00:18:12.440 so I'm not suggesting that you can't
00:18:14.080 make money on those moves but as you
00:18:16.799 know from an academic perspective right
00:18:18.760 from an academic perspective if you told
00:18:21.400 someone that didn't own Ada never heard
00:18:24.679 of ADA before right if you told
00:18:27.080 someone that
00:18:29.440 you feel bad because you missed the boat
00:18:32.000 and you're showing them this
00:18:33.840 chart what would they think right I mean
00:18:36.360 you know you would look at this chart
00:18:37.520 and be like well what did you miss right
00:18:38.919 these are all just lower highs that that
00:18:41.559 have have sort of transpired doesn't
00:18:43.280 mean it can't eventually turn into
00:18:44.520 something different and it probably will
00:18:46.240 right I mean I I do think Ada Bitcoin
00:18:48.000 has a good chance of of actually going
00:18:49.840 up in
00:18:51.880 2025 if you look at at at yearly uh
00:18:55.679 candles let's take a look at this
00:19:00.320 when did adaa Bitcoin go up last cycle
00:19:02.440 when did it really go up don't get me
00:19:04.080 this you know 30% move of the wick to
00:19:06.600 the upside right when did it really go
00:19:08.720 up 2021 when did it go up the second
00:19:12.120 before that 2017
00:19:16.720 so maybe it's just 2017 2021 2025
00:19:21.600 right so I do want I do want people to
00:19:23.840 be aware of that of that outcome where
00:19:25.960 like you know a a Bitcoin
00:19:29.600 gets this correction that it's in right
00:19:32.760 now and it kind of Fades for a little
00:19:35.000 bit and then perhaps it starts to show
00:19:37.559 renewed strength
00:19:39.799 whenever QE returns right um and it's
00:19:45.200 just something you know obviously I've
00:19:47.520 thought a lot about and I I remember
00:19:50.200 kind of what it did over here right it
00:19:51.679 had it had this Spike right it had this
00:19:55.440 Spike and then it did a lower low in
00:19:58.240 December January and then it went
00:20:00.880 up
00:20:02.919 so it's hard to say right it's hard to
00:20:05.400 say but you can kind of see where I'm
00:20:07.159 coming from right where you get and
00:20:09.440 again like just because it was a lower
00:20:10.760 low over here doesn't mean it has to be
00:20:12.280 a lower low over here it's all about
00:20:14.159 just like when is it weak when is it
00:20:15.760 strong and here it was strong in
00:20:18.440 November just like it was over here and
00:20:21.120 then it was weak in December just like
00:20:23.520 it is right
00:20:24.640 now and you can see that adaa Bitcoin
00:20:27.159 basically went down and every week of
00:20:29.720 December and it bottomed early January
00:20:33.080 of 2021 if you're curious and you want
00:20:35.360 to look at the day that it bottomed in
00:20:37.880 2021 right the day that adaa Bitcoin
00:20:40.200 bottomed right here and not not the
00:20:42.919 actual bottom but like a the this low
00:20:45.640 before it really start to move up it was
00:20:47.520 January 3rd okay January 3rd so I listen
00:20:51.640 I wouldn't be that surprised to see some
00:20:54.120 of these altcoins find renewed strength
00:20:56.799 about a year after the launch of the bit
00:20:58.679 coin ETF on their Bitcoin pairs right I
00:21:01.240 wouldn't be that surprised to see some
00:21:02.200 of these alss find renewed strength on
00:21:03.640 their Bitcoin pairs about a year after
00:21:05.520 the launch of the spot ETF for
00:21:08.000 Bitcoin so keep this idea in mind keep
00:21:10.640 this idea in mind um for Ada Bitcoin for
00:21:13.799 80 USD as I said previously you know at
00:21:17.240 the very least you were going to retest
00:21:18.960 this which we have because that's
00:21:20.480 exactly what happened last year right
00:21:22.159 and you know I I still am of the opinion
00:21:24.240 right like if it's not broke try not to
00:21:25.600 fix it right just kind of a defer to the
00:21:27.520 market try to listen to Market's telling
00:21:29.320 you and and say you know there's also a
00:21:31.679 chance it could go lower especially if
00:21:33.400 it follows what it did last cycle right
00:21:35.799 where it it
00:21:37.720 um you know it had a had a deeper
00:21:40.080 correction in terms of percent this drop
00:21:42.520 was about a 56% drop right so if it were
00:21:44.960 to drop 56% that would actually put you
00:21:47.520 below 60 cents right which would
00:21:49.320 actually put you right in here which is
00:21:52.600 right where it went last time right when
00:21:54.039 it had this drop it went right in here
00:21:56.799 you see what I'm saying
00:22:00.039 now there is a scenario where you know
00:22:03.679 it it it ex it continues to expand on
00:22:06.799 the the broadening wedge and I I don't
00:22:09.440 really want to spend too much time
00:22:11.559 harping on this scenario because I don't
00:22:13.080 I mean I I don't really want to make
00:22:14.480 people uh mad um but you know there
00:22:18.200 there's always a chance that it it just
00:22:19.919 kind of comes back down here
00:22:22.559 because Powell just says no no QE you
00:22:26.120 know continue on uh play playing in the
00:22:28.880 sandbox and the crypts and we'll give
00:22:30.279 you QE sometime later on there's a
00:22:32.480 chance that that happens um but you know
00:22:36.520 I I do think that even if that were to
00:22:38.400 happen you could still get a scenario
00:22:40.559 like this where you get sort of like
00:22:42.240 another double top type of a thing where
00:22:44.600 it continues to climb it right something
00:22:46.919 like that could play out um furthermore
00:22:49.480 the other thing to look at is the bull
00:22:50.720 market support band right the bull
00:22:51.960 market support band for Ada to bitcoin
00:22:53.320 you can see that first of all it Wicked
00:22:54.919 below it over here but it had a weekly
00:22:56.679 close right around the 20we SMA over
00:22:59.159 here it was just above the 21 we EMA so
00:23:01.760 I would also keep an eye on that and the
00:23:03.640 20we estimate for Ada is around 56 cents
00:23:06.679 the 21 we EMA is around 67 cents so that
00:23:09.720 would also correspond to kind of like
00:23:11.520 right back in there okay so just keep an
00:23:14.080 eye on that as well
00:23:16.120 um and uh we'll take it you know we'll
00:23:18.159 take a one step at a time obviously I
00:23:20.440 don't have a crystal ball I would if you
00:23:23.039 find someone with a crystal ball I would
00:23:25.880 I would not tell anyone about them
00:23:27.520 because hope they can make you a lot of
00:23:29.400 money we're just over here dubiously
00:23:31.960 speculating about things trying to
00:23:33.360 figure out what's what and who's who in
00:23:34.840 the cryptoverse and and and also trying
00:23:37.600 to make sense of of of Bitcoin dominance
00:23:39.880 because I think you start off your first
00:23:41.760 cycle not really caring about Bitcoin
00:23:43.279 dominance once you've really lived
00:23:45.360 through it for an entire cycle and you
00:23:47.159 see the altcoin that you really like
00:23:48.880 just kind of bleed against Bitcoin you
00:23:51.000 then start to recognize all right hey
00:23:52.880 maybe there's something to this Bitcoin
00:23:55.240 dominant stuff and and and and I and I
00:23:57.559 know that last
00:23:59.440 cycle dominance topped it had two tops
00:24:03.000 right the first top was when QE ended
00:24:06.000 and the second top was January of the
00:24:08.320 post tapping
00:24:10.200 year I'd like to present an idea and
00:24:12.640 I've done this a few times what if these
00:24:15.760 two tops end up being the same Top This
00:24:19.400 cycle right what if they end up being
00:24:21.400 the same top where QE returns hopefully
00:24:24.440 sometime early 2025 but then you also
00:24:26.960 get this sort of this seasonal top
00:24:29.640 January of the postt year and what
00:24:31.960 happens if it just ends up looking like
00:24:34.520 that where you know you kind of go up
00:24:35.880 and you put another high that ends up
00:24:37.880 being the top and then it just kind of
00:24:39.279 does something like that is that
00:24:41.320 possible
00:24:42.880 maybe you know Bitcoin dominance for me
00:24:45.559 60% was always the
00:24:48.039 target um and and that's why I don't
00:24:50.600 really feel compelled too strongly to
00:24:52.159 say that you know ate a Bitcoin it's not
00:24:53.919 like it has to go back down to 400 stats
00:24:57.080 because you know if you look at like
00:24:58.039 sort of the FIB retracement here the
00:24:59.600 Bitcoin dominance already retraced the
00:25:01.480 6.8 FIB just like last cycle uh if you
00:25:04.279 look at the the bubble of alts against
00:25:06.640 Bitcoin that began right here you can
00:25:09.000 see that dominance retraced that entire
00:25:11.159 move uh but the the sort of the elephant
00:25:15.120 right is that if all Bitcoin pairs do
00:25:20.120 eventually return to the range low then
00:25:23.320 you know it's going to be hard to see
00:25:25.399 all Bitcoin pairs down here without AA
00:25:28.039 Bitcoin coin also taking a big hit right
00:25:30.640 and just remember you know a a
00:25:33.760 Bitcoin was that or sorry alt Bitcoin
00:25:36.279 pairs were at
00:25:38.159 0.25 around this time last cycle and
00:25:41.440 they were also at this level in October
00:25:43.760 2017 and in September of 2019 and in
00:25:46.799 June of 2020 right so it it can happen I
00:25:49.840 would argue again as I said earlier
00:25:51.880 right if it doesn't happen if we don't
00:25:54.840 go down here which we don't have to
00:25:56.320 right I mean I'm satisfied with dominant
00:25:58.399 at 60% right I
00:26:00.640 am and I don't know if I'm trying to
00:26:02.480 convince you or me honestly but I'm
00:26:05.159 satisfied with it but what I would
00:26:07.840 say is that if all Bitcoin pairs don't
00:26:12.039 go down here then they also probably
00:26:15.039 don't go up here okay and you can kind
00:26:17.720 of understand that by looking at the xrp
00:26:19.640 Bitcoin valuation from earlier right you
00:26:21.720 don't have to go to the range low but if
00:26:24.120 you don't you're probably not going to
00:26:25.600 go to the Range High the way you go to
00:26:27.799 the range highe is you get these massive
00:26:31.080 capitulations by Alt Bitcoin pairs that
00:26:34.520 make everyone think that altcoins are
00:26:36.919 truly dead on their Bitcoin Pairs and
00:26:40.240 then just when you least expect it alt
00:26:42.799 season
00:26:43.880 begins right and I I just I don't I mean
00:26:47.000 again last cycle All Season occurred in
00:26:49.960 January 2021 cycle before that it didn't
00:26:52.640 really occur until Q4 of the post having
00:26:55.240 year so there's no guarantee that you
00:26:57.039 get an altseason immediate medely in
00:26:58.720 January it could be delayed until later
00:27:00.960 on um but I did I did at least want to
00:27:04.880 talk about all Bitcoin pairs I wanted to
00:27:07.120 talk about uh cardano not only on its
00:27:10.000 USD pair but also on its Bitcoin pair
00:27:12.200 arguably the Bitcoin pair is in fact
00:27:13.919 more important uh than than the USD pair
00:27:17.000 but I do know a lot of you guys are are
00:27:18.799 more so interested in the USD valuation
00:27:21.799 of of ADA but anyways guys you know
00:27:25.320 we'll we'll try to wrap it up there
00:27:26.720 we'll follow this wedge pattern here and
00:27:29.120 and kind of see what happens
00:27:31.799 historically if you if you believe that
00:27:33.919 this is sort of a an ascending
00:27:35.600 broadening wedge which to some degree I
00:27:38.080 have trouble believing it just because
00:27:39.480 you know there's kind of a fake out here
00:27:42.039 historically they break up a little more
00:27:45.640 sorry they break up a maybe like 46 47%
00:27:48.919 of the time they break down a little
00:27:50.679 more than 50% of the time last cycle it
00:27:53.679 you can see that it did break down right
00:27:56.559 um and a real breakdown not just kind of
00:27:58.640 like this but there are times where they
00:28:00.720 don't you know they don't really break
00:28:02.320 down and this is based on on Forex
00:28:04.360 markets where they do eventually break
00:28:06.200 break to the upside so again this is all
00:28:08.640 just chasing one narrative after
00:28:11.120 another neither side getting what they
00:28:13.600 want um we'll try to remain objective
00:28:16.840 and unbiased over here as best as I can

00:28:28.679 and if you're interested in altcoins in
00:28:30.200 general if you're interested in cardano

00:28:35.440 click on one uh for instance since since
00:28:37.720 this video is about ADA you can click on
00:28:38.960 Ada and then any chart that pops up here
00:28:41.519 would be a chart in fact on Ada right so
00:28:43.640 if you're curious about say like the
00:28:45.519 hotle waves for cardano and you and you
00:28:47.960 want to know what are long-term holders
00:28:49.880 doing right I don't care what people are
00:28:51.039 saying on X I don't care what people are
00:28:52.279 saying on YouTube I want to know what
00:28:54.000 people are actually doing right um
00:28:57.600 there's a uh I'm not going to say um but
00:28:59.919 anyways you can see that long-term
00:29:01.960 holders regardless of what they're
00:29:03.880 telling you regardless of what they're
00:29:05.679 telling you on Twitter uh there are some
00:29:07.519 long-term holders selling into this pump
00:29:09.360 Ian you can see it right I mean you can
00:29:10.760 see the hotle waves I mean you can see
00:29:13.440 that you know they are right the they're
00:29:17.120 going down and and I mean it could be an
00:29:18.679 artifact too of just uh short-term
00:29:20.279 holders coming to the party you can see
00:29:21.720 that short-term holders are starting to
00:29:22.919 go up a little bit here um which is a
00:29:26.039 little different than what you saw in in
00:29:28.159 some in in last year right you know you
00:29:30.320 didn't even really see any return of
00:29:31.919 short-term holders last year you're
00:29:33.039 getting a little bit of a return this
00:29:34.320 year but it's still not what you saw in
00:29:36.159 2021 and it's certainly not what you saw
00:29:38.120 in 2017 early 2018 but again like you
00:29:40.919 can go through these charts for cardano
00:29:43.760 you could go through them for other
00:29:44.760 altcoins and you can try to figure out
00:29:46.880 you know what's going on I don't have
00:29:48.039 all the time in the world to explain
00:29:49.399 everything every single altcoin on here
00:29:51.320 go through every single chart but if you
00:29:52.840 are curious about an altcoin and you
00:29:54.679 want to explore it you want to research
00:29:56.200 it we do have a lot of the tools on ITC

# Why Did Bitcoin Drop Today?
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/m1-tysC1Hds

00:00:00.799 hey everyone and thanks for jumping back
00:00:02.240 into the cryptoverse today we're going
00:00:04.799 to talk about Bitcoin and the long end
00:00:07.879 of the yield curve so we're going to be
00:00:09.120 talking about Bitcoin and yields very
00:00:11.799 exotic concept I'm sure many of you are
00:00:14.599 very excited if you guys like the
00:00:16.320 content make sure you subscribe to the
00:00:17.640 channel give the video a thumbs up and
00:00:19.039 again check out the sale on intothe
00:00:20.640 cryptoverse premium at intothe
00:00:22.119 cryptoverse decom so bitcoin's about
00:00:25.160 down 5% today which all in all uh isn't
00:00:29.439 isn't so bad but I do want to talk about
00:00:32.159 you know what's going on today um is
00:00:35.280 there a narrative to support such a move
00:00:38.559 and take it from there now you should
00:00:40.840 know that my base case with price action
00:00:45.360 is that price action is King and it does
00:00:47.440 not really follow any narrative in fact
00:00:50.640 it's the other way around right
00:00:51.800 narrative follows price so if the price
00:00:54.680 goes up if the price were up today we
00:00:57.320 would all have a narrative for it right
00:00:59.680 um
00:01:00.760 the price goes down we'd all have a
00:01:02.320 narrative for it so I think it's
00:01:04.879 important to remember that no matter
00:01:06.840 what happens um we will always be able
00:01:10.040 to find a narrative to explain anything
00:01:14.640 especially with the benefit of hindsight
00:01:17.360 right so it's important to remember that
00:01:19.640 but if we try to break down you know
00:01:21.920 what is going in the market what could
00:01:24.159 be the cause of of such a move I think
00:01:27.439 one of the things to look at would in
00:01:29.520 fact be be the Yi curve okay now I'm not
00:01:34.640 talking right now about the
00:01:48.650 [Music]
00:01:50.640 uninversity uninverted
00:01:53.159 and it can precede slowdowns in the
00:01:57.200 economy um but sometimes those slowdowns
00:01:59.960 take a couple of months sometimes it
00:02:02.280 takes years for it to play out for
00:02:04.920 instance in 1967 you had an inverted y
00:02:08.038 Cur or sorry 1966 you had an inverted y
00:02:10.280 curve the market didn't really care for
00:02:12.280 quite some time but I'm not really
00:02:15.319 talking about the
00:02:25.760 uninversity old curve for the purposes
00:02:28.239 of this video and the reason reason why
00:02:31.000 the the long and deal curve is important
00:02:33.440 is because when it really starts to move
00:02:35.959 up it can take the wind out of the sales
00:02:40.040 of risk assets right it can it can
00:02:42.319 really take the wind out of the sales if
00:02:44.200 you're not familiar with what I'm
00:02:45.920 talking about if you were to Simply
00:02:48.599 overlay
00:02:50.200 Bitcoin onto the chart of the yield
00:02:52.560 curve what you'll notice is that when
00:02:54.840 the 10year yield was getting this major
00:02:57.879 move up from you know 1% basically all
00:03:02.440 the way up to 4% that was mostly when
00:03:05.640 Bitcoin was going through its typical
00:03:08.319 bare Market in the midterm year right
00:03:11.000 you got a bare Market in 2014 2018 and
00:03:14.400 2022 there's always a reason right
00:03:16.840 there's always a reason uh you could
00:03:18.760 blame it on on FTX you could blame it on
00:03:22.200 any number of other companies going down
00:03:24.680 right blame it on anything you could
00:03:27.440 blame it on the 10year year the 10year
00:03:29.799 yield going
00:03:31.319 up there's always reason right but
00:03:34.519 that's not really what's important if
00:03:36.799 you look closely though you'll see that
00:03:39.400 once the 10-year yield found this top
00:03:42.799 here even though it wasn't the top it
00:03:45.760 was a majority of this move right the
00:03:48.760 10year yield went to about
00:03:50.799 4.3% by by you know the end of 2022
00:03:53.879 October of 2022 and it's true that it
00:03:56.360 did ultimately go up to about 5% a year
00:03:59.480 later
00:04:01.040 a majority of the move by the 10year
00:04:03.079 yield was over by this point and ever
00:04:06.319 since then it's been trying to slowly
00:04:08.560 chop a little bit higher but it hasn't
00:04:10.680 really gone that much
00:04:13.079 higher so when the 10-year yield tops
00:04:16.959 Bitcoin finds the bottom and as long as
00:04:20.358 the 10-year yield was going
00:04:22.560 down Bitcoin was going up but what
00:04:26.840 you'll notice is that when the 10year
00:04:30.360 yield started this move here right when
00:04:33.160 it started this move here initially
00:04:35.240 Bitcoin sold off right you see that
00:04:37.199 Bitcoin sold off on this bottom of the
00:04:39.800 10-year yield the 10year yield started
00:04:41.840 going
00:04:43.039 up Bitcoin actually popped up a little
00:04:45.560 bit right there but as the 10year
00:04:48.440 continued to go up it took the wind out
00:04:51.400 of the sales for Bitcoin right and it
00:04:53.680 and Bitcoin eventually came back down
00:04:56.759 okay and and you can actually see
00:04:58.919 something h something very very similar
00:05:01.360 happened again last year uh not to the
00:05:04.520 same extent though uh but as the 10-year
00:05:07.440 yield was starting to go back up here
00:05:11.000 you can see that Bitcoin started to to
00:05:13.680 sell off a little bit okay so I I think
00:05:17.120 the argument is this right if 10year
00:05:20.479 yield goes up too much then it can take
00:05:23.600 the wind out of the sales
00:05:25.840 temporarily I'll show you you know I'll
00:05:28.000 show you what I'm talking about here as
00:05:29.240 it relates to the S&P 500 as well let's
00:05:32.680 zoom in the initial move by the 10-year
00:05:36.000 yield uh back over here didn't really
00:05:38.759 mean a whole lot okay so if you look at
00:05:41.960 the 10year yield as it sort of bottomed
00:05:44.479 out in March of 2023 and it started to
00:05:47.960 go up into April of 2023 Bitcoin didn't
00:05:52.039 really care right it didn't in fact if
00:05:54.880 you were to Overlay the S&P 500 onto
00:05:57.759 that chart what you'll notice is that
00:06:00.319 the S&P you know essentially had had had
00:06:03.880 no problem going up as the 10year yield
00:06:07.160 was going up because the understanding
00:06:09.400 was that there could there's a chance
00:06:10.919 that it's just rejected by this trend
00:06:13.000 line right and initially it was for
00:06:15.759 about a month but then it broke
00:06:18.599 out and then it came back down tested
00:06:22.160 the 21 we EMA as
00:06:24.599 support and then on that test of support
00:06:28.800 the S&P 00 got this correction right
00:06:32.680 there okay and as the S&P dropped here
00:06:38.759 the 10year yield was going up do you see
00:06:42.440 that right so as the after the longin
00:06:45.280 broke out and back tested support
00:06:48.880 corresponding with the 21 we
00:06:51.160 EMA it boun the 10e yield bounced up the
00:06:55.400 S&P sold off and then the S&P 500 bottom
00:07:01.000 it
00:07:02.759 bottomed after the 10year yield toed do
00:07:06.599 you see it it's pretty clear okay it's
00:07:09.160 pretty clear what happened back then and
00:07:12.160 so what we're faced with today over the
00:07:15.160 last few weeks we saw it start it
00:07:16.840 started in December we saw something
00:07:19.360 very very similar right you can see that
00:07:22.000 kind of like 2023 in fact right it's
00:07:24.280 almost identical
00:07:25.879 2023 you had these lower highs right the
00:07:30.639 third lower high the 10 year yeld broke
00:07:33.039 through and that's when the S&P sold off
00:07:35.360 now you're probably like well isn't this
00:07:36.280 video about Bitcoin it is but Bitcoin
00:07:39.560 you know if the S&P is going up
00:07:40.960 bitcoin's usually going up if bitcoin's
00:07:42.479 going down the S&P is usually going down
00:07:44.120 at least that's normally what happens
00:07:45.639 there are times when it deviates uh but
00:07:48.440 that's usually what happens um in fact
00:07:50.879 you could actually look at at some
00:07:52.039 sometimes sort of the middle of last
00:07:53.039 year when Bitcoin was putting in lower
00:07:54.199 highs the S&P was not but that was very
00:07:56.400 similar to 2019 as well the same the
00:07:58.440 same year that we got rate or the same
00:08:00.599 part of the cycle we got rate Cuts last
00:08:02.280 last time so here you can see the same
00:08:05.599 structure right one two third times the
00:08:10.840 charm then it broke out right and then
00:08:13.840 after it broke out it then came back
00:08:16.039 down back tested the 21 we EMA as
00:08:19.360 support that's exactly what the 10e
00:08:21.280 yield did right there in July 2023 and
00:08:24.120 when it back tested that and found
00:08:26.400 support the 10-year yield got a big move
00:08:29.120 up
00:08:30.039 just like it did in 2023 you see
00:08:33.240 that and you could argue that the the
00:08:36.559 the the stalling the stalling out on the
00:08:39.240 S&P 500 so far is mostly just due to the
00:08:43.080 10year yield going up now here's the
00:08:45.920 interesting thing right this is the sort
00:08:47.800 of the fascinating thing about it is
00:08:49.440 that you might assume right you might
00:08:51.959 assume that the 10-year yield going up
00:08:56.000 does does that mean the economy is
00:08:57.959 slowing down right absolutely not right
00:09:00.640 that's not I mean it could lead to that
00:09:02.839 but in fact the longin going up means
00:09:06.040 the exact opposite right it means the
00:09:08.160 opposite it it actually means that the
00:09:09.880 economy has been doing okay because if
00:09:13.360 the economy were not doing okay the long
00:09:16.279 end of the O curve would be falling off
00:09:17.839 a cliff right I mean in fact if you look
00:09:21.800 at at at when recessions occur right if
00:09:24.200 you look at when recessions
00:09:25.920 occur normally they occur as the 10e you
00:09:29.640 know sort you know as they as they come
00:09:31.279 in like the 10year yield is dropping
00:09:33.680 right during recessions not going up so
00:09:37.920 I think the argument here is that you
00:09:40.880 know a lot of people sort of see risk
00:09:42.560 asset selling off and they're like why
00:09:44.880 is it selling off right you know what's
00:09:46.399 going on we had some labor market data
00:09:48.720 today right that came in and and it
00:09:50.720 actually came in it was sort of a mixed
00:09:52.839 bag and we we'll go through it more on
00:09:54.680 Friday after we have all the data but
00:09:57.240 just just to kind of give you a heads up
00:10:00.320 um we had a few things come in today
00:10:02.240 right we had hirers uh which came
00:10:06.079 in uh you know it dropped again so
00:10:08.680 that's not really good to see but job
00:10:11.120 openings actually went up right if you
00:10:13.360 look at job openings job openings
00:10:14.880 actually went a little bit higher so
00:10:16.839 that's a good thing to see and one again
00:10:19.160 I I don't really have a strong
00:10:20.240 conviction on this so don't hold it
00:10:21.920 against me in six months but one thing
00:10:23.800 to consider is that the FED began
00:10:26.079 raising rates I believe in March of 2022
00:10:29.399 that's when job openings topped the FED
00:10:31.920 began they they they ended or sorry they
00:10:34.720 they they had their first rate cut I
00:10:36.279 believe it was in September of 2024 and
00:10:39.079 you can see that's actually so far when
00:10:40.760 job openings bottomed okay so you could
00:10:45.040 argue well you know if if job openings
00:10:47.680 is bouncing here right why is the market
00:10:50.760 selling off well I I think the issue
00:10:52.920 right I think the issue right now is
00:10:55.079 that the Fed was unwilling to
00:10:58.040 potentially keep rates as high as they
00:10:59.800 should have for as long as they should
00:11:01.760 have and you could argue that the bond
00:11:04.279 market is revolting right and the bond
00:11:06.600 market is essentially trying to
00:11:08.560 accomplish what the FED is unwilling to
00:11:10.639 do okay because the FED does not control
00:11:14.000 the long end of the Y curve right they
00:11:15.440 control the short end if you look at at
00:11:18.279 at the short end of the Y
00:11:20.440 curve you can see that you know the the
00:11:24.120 one month yield is
00:11:26.279 4.3% Right which is just below 4.5% %
00:11:29.639 right that's the the the current uh Fed
00:11:32.440 fundes rate so the FED controls the
00:11:34.959 short end not the long end and you can
00:11:37.880 see that because ever since the FED cut
00:11:40.360 rates right even the two-year yield has
00:11:42.360 gone up right the FED cut rates right
00:11:44.560 here in September and ever since they
00:11:46.519 cut the two-year yield went
00:11:48.800 up now we talked about this you see this
00:11:51.320 Arrow we drew this arrow in
00:11:54.639 September and I said guys you know until
00:11:57.880 initial claims are printed 300K there's
00:12:00.720 no reason to assume that the 2-year
00:12:02.720 yield is going to be breaking down so if
00:12:06.040 initial claims are still so low then
00:12:08.240 what the hell is the 10 year or the
00:12:09.920 two-year yield doing it 3 and a half%
00:12:11.959 doesn't make any sense so the only
00:12:13.519 direction for the two-year yield to go
00:12:15.560 was
00:12:16.600 up and the FED controls less and less of
00:12:20.519 the yield curve as you get further out
00:12:22.720 onto it and and let me explain what I
00:12:24.880 mean so at at any given point the market
00:12:27.680 is sort of weighing you know a couple of
00:12:29.600 different outcomes a few different
00:12:30.560 outcomes but the two most prevalent
00:12:32.720 narratives in this cycle are is the
00:12:35.639 labor market still doing
00:12:37.880 okay and is inflation going to come back
00:12:41.000 those are the two things that the market
00:12:42.560 is concerned about arguably the most
00:12:45.320 right now as I've
00:12:47.160 said initial claims are low right I mean
00:12:49.760 I look guys I get it job openings are
00:12:52.399 are back to pre-pandemic levels job
00:12:55.079 quits are as low as they've been you
00:12:58.600 know since since
00:13:01.079 2015 so it seems like the labor market
00:13:03.440 is struggling but here's the thing looks
00:13:06.240 can be deceiving in some ways if you
00:13:08.040 look at layoffs they're still relatively
00:13:10.560 low right they're only just now getting
00:13:13.880 back to where they were pre
00:13:15.760 pandemic if you look at initial claims
00:13:19.560 they're still relatively low right I
00:13:22.880 mean they're
00:13:24.120 211,000 right that's relatively it's a
00:13:26.519 relatively small number for initial
00:13:28.480 claims you know that that's a really
00:13:30.880 small number for initial claims in fact
00:13:33.760 you'd be hard pressed to find that many
00:13:35.440 times in history where it was lower than
00:13:37.600 that okay that doesn't mean it can't
00:13:39.839 change but the point is that if initial
00:13:43.079 claims are low and and the unemployment
00:13:46.560 rate is low then the market is going to
00:13:50.519 sort of dismiss the labor market
00:13:52.959 weakness that is perceived because while
00:13:55.320 it's true that highers are down and it's
00:13:57.079 true that quits are down
00:14:00.480 it's that's all true but until companies
00:14:03.920 actually start laying people off then
00:14:07.279 the market will climb the wall of worry
00:14:10.079 right and so when you look at at
00:14:12.839 something like the unemployment rate
00:14:14.720 right when you look at the unemployment
00:14:16.240 rate it has been going up right it has
00:14:18.959 been going up but the reason it's been
00:14:21.680 the main reason it's been going up is
00:14:23.839 not because of layoffs right the main
00:14:26.040 reason it's going up is because of an
00:14:28.600 expanding labor force and you know that
00:14:31.759 because you can you can actually go over
00:14:34.320 to the um to the unemployment level by
00:14:37.440 reason for unemployment right and you
00:14:39.639 can see that yeah like people are losing
00:14:42.120 their jobs you can see they've been
00:14:43.680 losing their jobs but this is not a
00:14:45.560 parabolic rally by job losers right look
00:14:47.959 at the dot recession look at the
00:14:50.079 financial crisis those are parabolic
00:14:52.720 rallies by job L that's that's recession
00:14:55.560 right that is when you get a recession
00:14:57.040 when it when it goes up in an
00:14:59.120 uncontrolled way this here is mostly
00:15:02.440 controlled right this is what the FED
00:15:04.320 wanted to happen they wanted to loosen
00:15:06.800 up the labor market and the reason is
00:15:08.800 because of wage inflation right wage
00:15:10.519 inflation contributes a significant
00:15:12.839 amount to just the overall inflationary
00:15:15.720 pressures
00:15:17.360 so what is causing the unemployment rate
00:15:19.720 to go up mostly it's because I'm glad
00:15:22.279 you asked right new entrance to the
00:15:24.639 labor force look at that that has been
00:15:26.920 going up a lot and why is it going up
00:15:29.440 because a lot of people aren't hiring
00:15:30.800 anyone so it's a hard Market to get a
00:15:34.959 job but it's not as hard of a market to
00:15:38.240 keep a job right if you have a job it's
00:15:40.839 a lot easier to keep it than it has been
00:15:43.880 in a long time or at least I mean it's
00:15:46.279 it's about the same as it has been the
00:15:47.319 last few years but to compareed to say
00:15:49.040 like 15 years ago it's so much easier to
00:15:50.720 keep the job and it has been over the
00:15:52.560 last couple
00:15:53.759 years than you know 15 years
00:15:57.240 ago so people aren't really getting laid
00:16:00.199 off as
00:16:02.000 quickly it's that new people coming into
00:16:04.720 the market are having a TR are having a
00:16:06.759 hard time finding a job and you could
00:16:09.600 argue that the people that really you
00:16:11.480 know have the most the biggest effect on
00:16:13.399 where the stock market goes are not the
00:16:15.639 new people into the labor market that
00:16:17.240 are just starting off and and are
00:16:19.480 looking to build their wealth it's the
00:16:21.399 people that have been in the stock
00:16:22.560 market for years and decades that have
00:16:24.959 wealth and they've accumulated it and
00:16:26.759 those are the people that are they still
00:16:28.279 have their jobs right and they're still
00:16:30.040 doing okay so I think that is kind of
00:16:33.279 the thing here so when you think about
00:16:35.440 like why is Bitcoin going down you know
00:16:38.680 is it because the economy is is slowing
00:16:41.040 down is it because of something else if
00:16:43.199 you look at like the 10-year yield and
00:16:45.680 you're watching the 10-year yield go up
00:16:49.680 the fact that it's going up means the
00:16:52.319 economy is still doing okay today
00:16:54.560 because if the economy were not doing
00:16:56.480 okay the 10-year yield will be going
00:16:59.639 down the reason it's going
00:17:03.199 up is
00:17:05.439 because we might see or it's the the
00:17:08.199 market is worried about the potential re
00:17:10.839 acceleration of inflation so the
00:17:13.119 headlines today were job openings and
00:17:14.959 whatnot but I'll tell you what I
00:17:16.919 actually don't really think the job
00:17:18.240 openings had a strong impact on on the
00:17:20.439 yield curve today I think what really it
00:17:22.240 was again it's a narrative for
00:17:23.480 everything so exactly what I'm about to
00:17:25.240 say just completely ignore it but if I
00:17:28.439 had to get yes I would say that the
00:17:31.240 reason the 10e yield is going up is not
00:17:33.520 so much because of job openings right I
00:17:35.160 mean who really cares if job openings is
00:17:36.960 at 8 million versus 7.8 right it's not
00:17:39.120 really that big of a deal and any you
00:17:41.160 know regardless the difference is
00:17:42.559 probably going to get revised away in a
00:17:43.880 couple of months anyways I think the
00:17:46.600 reason it's going up is because of this
00:17:50.480 the ism Services prices paid had a big
00:17:55.559 move up in December of 2024 you see that
00:17:59.440 the the actual value that came in and
00:18:02.120 this is you know this is going to
00:18:02.960 contribute to inflation obviously this
00:18:04.360 is prices paid
00:18:06.400 64.4 last month it was only 58.2 and the
00:18:09.799 the forecast was only 57 a half so it
00:18:12.559 completely blew the expectations out of
00:18:15.159 the water right I mean it it was a lot
00:18:17.080 higher I think the Counterpoint is that
00:18:19.360 there was also a kind of a a move up
00:18:21.559 last year around this time right so
00:18:24.919 maybe it's just repeating that but this
00:18:26.919 print by the ism services prices paid it
00:18:30.760 hasn't been that high since February of
00:18:34.640 2023 February of 2023 so I think what's
00:18:38.440 going on is you know the Market's
00:18:41.640 obviously looking at the labor market
00:18:43.280 and seeing that you know it's loosened
00:18:44.960 up a lot and it's probably going to
00:18:46.520 continue to loosen up over the next 6 to
00:18:48.480 12 months but the reason the long end of
00:18:52.600 the old curve is going
00:18:55.000 up
00:18:56.640 potentially is because
00:18:59.240 the Market's like well what if inflation
00:19:01.400 comes back and it's not like right now
00:19:03.480 my base case is not a second wave of
00:19:06.039 inflation and not at least not
00:19:07.280 immediately and then not to the same
00:19:09.080 extent that we had here in 2022 that
00:19:11.039 doesn't mean you can eventually get one
00:19:12.480 right you could get one maybe in 2026
00:19:14.880 you know if you look at the 1970s the
00:19:17.880 first Peak was in February of 70 1970
00:19:20.720 the second Peak was you know almost 5
00:19:24.480 years later I mean it was December of
00:19:25.840 1974 but that's only 3 months away from
00:19:27.760 being 5 years later to give you an idea
00:19:29.919 5 years after that Peak would put you
00:19:31.480 out in say you know
00:19:33.120 2027 okay and then from this peak to the
00:19:35.679 next one it was from 74 the end of 74 to
00:19:39.640 1980 right so that was like six years
00:19:42.919 okay so but I but here's the thing I I
00:19:45.760 think the market is wondering if you
00:19:47.720 look here in
00:19:49.159 1972 the the the infl headline inflation
00:19:51.880 actually bottomed out in the summer and
00:19:53.360 then it started going up and then once
00:19:55.000 you got into the postelection year
00:19:58.799 inflation surged and you ended up
00:20:00.880 getting a left translated
00:20:02.880 cycle normally you get right translated
00:20:05.440 Cycles where the market goes up for
00:20:08.600 three years and drops for one right
00:20:10.760 here's a good example of one 1962 right
00:20:13.120 but you can see the market went up for a
00:20:14.600 long time 1962 to 1965 and then in 1966
00:20:19.120 it dropped so you had a a three-year
00:20:20.840 bull market and then a one-year bear but
00:20:23.320 then the next cycle you had a 2-year
00:20:25.520 bull market and then a 2-year bear and
00:20:27.640 then the cycle after that you had a
00:20:28.799 two-year bull market and then a 2-year
00:20:30.360 bear so you had a right translated cycle
00:20:32.760 and then you had two left translated
00:20:35.720 Cycles with crypto we've only ever known
00:20:39.320 right translated Cycles right that's all
00:20:41.200 we've ever known right if you go look at
00:20:43.200 at Bitcoin every single bull market that
00:20:45.880 it's had in history has been a right
00:20:49.080 translated cycle right I mean every
00:20:51.080 single one and hopefully that's what we
00:20:53.600 get again right hope for the best plan
00:20:55.799 for the worst right but hope that it
00:20:57.240 plays out like it usually does where you
00:20:59.679 get a sort of a three-year bull market
00:21:02.280 and then a one-year bear and then a
00:21:03.440 three-year bull and a one-year bear
00:21:05.039 three-year bull one-ear
00:21:07.720 bear hopefully we get another three-year
00:21:10.120 bull but that doesn't mean even if you
00:21:12.440 do get a three-year bull market that
00:21:13.960 doesn't mean you won't have people
00:21:15.760 questioning it and you could always have
00:21:17.279 a left translated cycle right I mean if
00:21:19.080 you look at at you know back over here
00:21:21.200 the S&P topped out in you know in
00:21:24.720 December November December of the
00:21:27.120 election year and then the following
00:21:28.840 cycle after that it topped out in
00:21:30.200 January of the post election year so
00:21:32.120 right around this time so again I'm not
00:21:34.039 saying it's going to play out like that
00:21:35.640 what I'm saying is that whether it plays
00:21:37.120 out like that or not you're going to
00:21:38.240 have some people questioning whether
00:21:39.640 it's going to play out like that so that
00:21:41.400 could be where some of the the the worry
00:21:43.520 is coming from is is inflation actually
00:21:46.880 reaccelerating because that's when it
00:21:49.000 started to re accelerate in 1972 was
00:21:51.039 going into the post election year and if
00:21:54.760 inflation re
00:21:56.039 accelerates then the market sells off
00:21:59.279 right the market sells
00:22:01.559 off but I'll tell you what I I'll tell
00:22:03.840 you the reason why I don't think we're
00:22:05.679 going to see inflation accelerate the
00:22:07.440 exact same way it did in the 1970s I'll
00:22:09.520 tell you why the reason is because if we
00:22:13.159 go over to the workbench right and we
00:22:14.640 look at at say like the unemployment
00:22:17.520 rate and let's just remove everything
00:22:19.640 else um there's the unemployment rate if
00:22:22.400 you overlay onto this chart if you
00:22:27.000 overlay um in inflation headline
00:22:30.360 inflation you'll notice that in the
00:22:32.520 1970s when the unemployment rate or
00:22:35.000 sorry when inflation was going when
00:22:36.840 inflation was going
00:22:39.240 um up right this purple line as it was
00:22:41.880 going up the unemployment rate was going
00:22:44.279 down right you see that the unemployment
00:22:46.039 rate was going down as the as inflation
00:22:48.840 was going up but this cycle we're not
00:22:50.840 seeing that right we're seeing inflation
00:22:52.240 come down but the unemployment rate is
00:22:54.480 already going out right the unemployment
00:22:55.919 rate is not going down if the
00:22:57.080 unemployment rate were going down right
00:22:58.679 now I'd be a little bit more concerned
00:23:01.159 about inflation reaccelerating because
00:23:03.480 of wage inflation if people are getting
00:23:05.480 paid more they're going to go then you
00:23:07.320 know spend more on on goods and services
00:23:09.799 right but if they're you know if if if
00:23:11.840 the unemployment rate is is going up
00:23:14.720 then it's going to reduce wage inflation
00:23:16.720 Powell even said that if you do see
00:23:18.360 inflation accelerate it's probably not
00:23:20.559 going to really come from the labor
00:23:21.880 market at this point because the labor
00:23:23.600 market has loosened up so much so I'm
00:23:26.120 not as concerned about an exact rep to
00:23:28.720 the 1970s right now because in the 1970s
00:23:32.159 when inflation started to go back up it
00:23:34.279 was when the unemployment rate was going
00:23:35.720 down but we're not seeing that right
00:23:37.200 we're seeing the unemployment rate go up
00:23:39.279 while inflation goes down so my point is
00:23:42.559 that this this increase in prices
00:23:47.559 paid it could just be a fluke like last
00:23:50.120 year it could be more than that but the
00:23:52.640 problem is that the market at this point
00:23:54.840 in time cannot know if it's a fluke or
00:23:57.159 not and so when you have job openings
00:24:00.000 coming in a little bit hot and you have
00:24:02.960 you know some worrying inflation
00:24:06.400 signals especially at the same time they
00:24:09.120 got in the
00:24:10.360 1970s it'd makees sense for the market
00:24:13.600 to at least make the question or ask the
00:24:16.080 question did the FED cut too soon and
00:24:18.600 it's possible they did but you could
00:24:20.600 also argue
00:24:22.720 that that we're only going to know in a
00:24:24.840 few years right it's certainly possible
00:24:27.159 that the FED is cutting exactly when
00:24:28.760 they needed to cut I think there's this
00:24:30.399 sort of this this idea that a lot of
00:24:32.399 people have that like the FED can't cut
00:24:33.919 if the markets at an alltime high but
00:24:36.000 you know the FED isn't trying
00:24:37.679 necessarily to crash the market to then
00:24:39.720 start cutting right ideally they would
00:24:41.760 cut before the market crashes let me
00:24:43.399 give you an
00:24:44.880 example if you go look at the
00:24:49.279 S&P in
00:24:51.559 1990 very similar cycle by with rates
00:24:55.520 actually if you go look at at interest
00:24:57.760 rates
00:24:59.399 what's interesting is the Fed also
00:25:01.000 raised
00:25:02.240 rates you know back over here to five
00:25:04.600 and a half or sorry here they they
00:25:07.440 initially raised to six but then they
00:25:09.120 dropped them down here they were five
00:25:10.240 and a half and then they dropped them
00:25:12.279 right and the reason I'm saying five and
00:25:13.279 a half is because that's exactly where
00:25:14.520 they've been for a little while right
00:25:15.600 here you see
00:25:17.120 that rates here were at the same as
00:25:20.200 rates here and then they lowered rates
00:25:22.840 to 4.75 which we just saw the FED lower
00:25:25.600 rates to 4.5 so the FED actually lowered
00:25:27.440 them do you know what actually caused
00:25:28.760 the FED to lower rates right here you
00:25:30.960 see that cut you see that aggressive cut
00:25:32.679 by the FED what was that well I think I
00:25:35.559 know what it was because if you look at
00:25:36.919 the S&P divided M2 you can see exactly
00:25:39.840 what it was and you can see it on the
00:25:40.960 S&P chart too but I like this chart a
00:25:42.240 little bit
00:25:43.120 better look at
00:25:45.720 this you see where the S&P divided M2 is
00:25:48.880 right now it's the same level it was at
00:25:52.320 in
00:25:53.960 1998 you see that that was not the top
00:25:57.440 of the market right but it did precede a
00:26:01.320 sort of a flash sort of a flash crash
00:26:03.559 down but again back then the FED cut
00:26:07.360 after the market dropped Now The fed's
00:26:11.159 Cutting to hopefully prevent something
00:26:13.679 like that from happening now who knows
00:26:15.600 if they'll be successful or not but
00:26:17.520 that's what I'm talking about right
00:26:18.799 that's what I'm talking about the FED
00:26:20.440 they're not they're trying to learn from
00:26:22.080 their mistakes and not make all the same
00:26:23.760 mistakes that they previously did but
00:26:25.080 there's always a chance that the market
00:26:27.440 just goes through this whole process
00:26:28.799 again right it you know it it sort of
00:26:30.559 went up it came back down and it just
00:26:32.279 did this and then eventually you know
00:26:34.279 you got a recession after years and
00:26:36.120 years and years but again I think you
00:26:38.520 have to at least consider that the
00:26:41.039 reason Bitcoin is dropping today is is
00:26:44.520 because the market is potentially
00:26:46.039 worried about inflation and and other
00:26:49.600 and you know and the labor market data
00:26:51.520 now there's a lot more labor market data
00:26:53.200 to come out this week so you know the
00:26:55.000 moves you see by Bitcoin today could
00:26:57.120 completely change by the the end of the
00:26:58.559 week right completely they could
00:27:00.000 completely change by the end of the week
00:27:01.720 but my point is if you're trying to
00:27:03.320 assign a narrative to something and
00:27:05.120 you're like what's going on like why is
00:27:07.159 the market doing this I think those are
00:27:09.200 the things that you have to consider
00:27:10.399 right now it is true that when the
00:27:13.279 tenure yield goes up it's a reflection
00:27:16.360 of a strong economy because if if
00:27:18.840 because again if it's going up it means
00:27:21.480 it's starting to worry about inflation
00:27:22.919 more than the labor market if it worried
00:27:24.360 about the labor market the 10year Y will
00:27:25.799 be going down but because it's going up
00:27:27.840 it's not concerned about Labor right now
00:27:29.799 it's more concerned about inflation but
00:27:32.279 again on Friday if the unemployment rate
00:27:34.000 comes in hot at like 4.3 or 4.4 then the
00:27:36.760 market might be concerned about the
00:27:37.799 labor market again it can flip-flop
00:27:40.360 right we're chasing
00:27:41.799 narratives but there is some truth to
00:27:44.039 the idea that the 10-year yield going up
00:27:47.919 can
00:27:49.000 cause can eventually cause the labor
00:27:51.399 market to really slow down right it can
00:27:53.080 lead to to layoffs um like imagine the
00:27:57.240 housing market right so people have been
00:27:58.559 waiting forever to buy a house because
00:28:00.399 they want to see rates come down they
00:28:01.640 thought that when the FED would cut
00:28:02.720 rates would come down the FED cut rates
00:28:04.240 went up right so that slows down parts
00:28:07.360 of the economy as long as rates stay
00:28:09.559 high so the 10e yeld going up actually
00:28:12.720 means the economy is doing okay but the
00:28:15.200 longer it goes up it could change that
00:28:18.840 risk right you know if the 10 year y old
00:28:21.080 were to keep on rallying it could
00:28:22.760 eventually lead to something else now
00:28:24.640 I've talked a lot about the 10-year
00:28:27.000 yield
00:28:29.240 potentially topping in q1 of 2025 that's
00:28:31.559 been my base case right and one of the
00:28:33.720 things to consider is that it actually
00:28:35.000 topped out the the 10e yield uh found a
00:28:39.240 a um a short-term top anyways in in sort
00:28:42.720 of early 2017 right you can see that the
00:28:44.880 10e yield here rallied into 2017 then it
00:28:48.240 topped after sweeping that high and then
00:28:51.000 it came back down for about a year
00:28:52.840 before then going up even higher you see
00:28:55.039 that so you could get a scenario like
00:28:57.080 that where you basically see the same
00:28:59.279 thing happen where it potentially
00:29:01.840 sweeps this high right like that high
00:29:05.240 right there just kind of like that's
00:29:07.000 what it did over here you see this high
00:29:08.880 this high was put in in June of 2015
00:29:11.159 that high right there April 2024 there's
00:29:13.240 also this High October 2023 so maybe it
00:29:15.600 even goes up and sleeps that High um but
00:29:19.320 I wouldn't be surprised if like the
00:29:21.919 market plays out in a way that you know
00:29:24.679 it it kind of sweeps either this high or
00:29:26.799 the high up here right one of those two
00:29:28.720 highs it then goes down for a little
00:29:31.080 while during that period you get some
00:29:33.440 type of scare growth scare that makes
00:29:36.159 the 10e yeld go down right because again
00:29:38.480 the way to make the 10e go down is for
00:29:40.559 the market to get more concerned about
00:29:42.039 growth than inflation and if the market
00:29:45.200 if something Spooks the market let's say
00:29:47.880 you get a bad labor market print
00:29:49.679 sometime you know in the next few months
00:29:52.440 that could cause the 10-year yield to go
00:29:54.640 down but that would actually likely
00:29:57.240 introduce
00:29:58.799 reintroduce quantitative
00:30:01.120 easing and that could be one of the
00:30:03.640 final levers that they pull to try to
00:30:06.000 keep the party going as long as they
00:30:08.159 can um because again back over here in
00:30:11.640 the 2016 2017 cycle right the 10- year
00:30:14.080 yield went up it then went down for you
00:30:17.799 know about a year that is when Bitcoin
00:30:20.480 dominance went down when the 10-year
00:30:22.799 yield finally started to go down but
00:30:24.760 then after you know three or four
00:30:26.840 quarters uh um you know we kind of had
00:30:29.000 to accept that the 10e Y was actually
00:30:30.440 going to go higher and then crypto
00:30:32.120 entered into a bare Market in
00:30:34.760 2018 so you know if it were to play out
00:30:37.679 like the last cycle then you know you
00:30:39.840 could get a growth Scare at some or two
00:30:42.120 cycles ago you could get a growth scare
00:30:44.159 somewhere that makes the 10-year yield
00:30:46.120 go down and I think the 10e yield would
00:30:48.640 likely put in a top in q1 that's my
00:30:51.000 guess and that something will happen to
00:30:54.039 make the 10-year yield drop something
00:30:56.600 will happen we'll get a bad data Point
00:30:58.360 somewhere and then the market will then
00:31:00.279 become more concerned about the labor
00:31:01.799 market than inflation but I don't know
00:31:03.679 exactly when and I don't know what it's
00:31:04.880 going to be but I'm going to guess it's
00:31:06.519 either going to sweep this high and drop
00:31:08.399 or sweep that high and
00:31:10.880 drop and then drop for maybe the rest of
00:31:13.320 the
00:31:14.080 year and then in 2026 maybe it it
00:31:17.080 actually goes up again or if you get a
00:31:19.880 recession it could drop a lot right so
00:31:22.760 but again that that larger drop or that
00:31:25.679 larger move up might not actually occur
00:31:27.600 until
00:31:28.480 2026 right sort of another leg higher
00:31:31.360 and and you can kind of see what I'm
00:31:32.519 talking about because the structure is
00:31:34.399 somewhat similar right you have this
00:31:36.000 High over here but then you have sort of
00:31:38.039 some shorter highs some lower highs um
00:31:41.480 so if it were to play out like 2016 you
00:31:43.720 know maybe it sweeps these highs comes
00:31:46.120 down for a little while and then in 2026
00:31:48.039 maybe it sweeps those Highs but again
00:31:49.519 that would be against the idea of a
00:31:50.960 recession if you get a recession the
00:31:52.559 10year yield has no business being at
00:31:55.600 5% if you get a recession the 10 you
00:31:58.159 would likely be down
00:32:00.200 here but I think that's what's happening
00:32:02.240 right so it's kind of a weird position
00:32:04.600 to be in because like you know you don't
00:32:06.399 really want to see a bad labor market
00:32:08.440 print like you don't want the
00:32:09.360 unemployment rate to go up you want
00:32:11.080 things to look okay so that Bitcoin can
00:32:13.600 go up but we're kind of at that weird
00:32:15.639 period where like good news is bad news
00:32:18.639 in a way like you know it's a good thing
00:32:20.480 to see job openings go up right it's a
00:32:23.039 good thing to see that stuff but you
00:32:25.639 know it also could be the bond Market's
00:32:27.519 way of revolting and saying yeah like
00:32:30.039 it's good but why is the Fed cut 100
00:32:32.799 basis
00:32:33.840 points when you know inflation
00:32:37.039 necessarily isn't back at their target
00:32:39.039 yet and you know it's not clear that
00:32:41.519 it's going to get back there in the
00:32:43.000 short term again it's no one actually
00:32:47.159 knows who's right right I mean the mark
00:32:48.799 you know Market participants are doing
00:32:50.360 the best they can no one knows sort of
00:32:53.320 the exactly the right answer exactly the
00:32:55.480 right thing to do but the point is that
00:32:57.919 any given point in time the market will
00:33:00.440 weigh you know the things that it's sure
00:33:02.519 of and then that's what determines the
00:33:05.240 price and right now the market seems a
00:33:08.559 little worried about growth uh re
00:33:11.799 accelerating which again isn't a bad
00:33:13.880 thing in and of itself but I think the
00:33:16.480 question the bond market is asking is if
00:33:19.679 growth is doing so well which it has
00:33:22.960 been right and if layoffs and if initial
00:33:25.799 claims are so low
00:33:28.720 then why is the Fed cutting so much
00:33:31.200 again I don't blame the flat I don't I
00:33:33.159 don't blame the FED at all they're
00:33:35.159 probably doing the right thing right
00:33:38.159 they probably are and again I I think a
00:33:40.600 lot of a lot of people need to get out
00:33:42.639 of the mindset that you know better than
00:33:44.919 than than they they do okay a lot of
00:33:46.960 people on crypto Twitter like we're all
00:33:48.440 armchair economists including myself and
00:33:50.760 we said here all high and mighty and try
00:33:53.440 to pretend like you know we could do
00:33:54.960 things better but the reality is is is
00:33:57.080 it's a lot more complicated than that it
00:33:59.080 really is and and a lot of people think
00:34:00.919 they're experts in things that they're
00:34:02.200 not and the more you study something the
00:34:04.240 more you realize you don't know about it
00:34:07.119 right um you know when I went to grad
00:34:09.760 school you know you go into it you feel
00:34:12.000 like you know a lot you go to grad
00:34:13.440 school you study one very specific topic
00:34:15.760 for five years and then you realize you
00:34:18.359 don't actually know anything right
00:34:19.960 because you you spend all this time
00:34:21.159 studying one tiny tiny topic and like
00:34:23.399 well you could study that about anything
00:34:24.599 in the world but yet so many people are
00:34:27.040 so convinced
00:34:28.359 that they're an expert on it but they're
00:34:30.280 not
00:34:31.639 right the only thing the only thing I
00:34:34.599 would consider myself an expert at is
00:34:37.000 not even really crypto I would say I I
00:34:39.480 I'm an expert um on on molecular Dynamic
00:34:43.239 simulations of radiation damage in
00:34:46.239 Ceramics and Inu transmission electr
00:34:48.719 microscopy and the reason is because
00:34:49.839 that's what my dissertation was on right
00:34:52.199 but this other stuff right it's I mean
00:34:53.599 it's dubious speculation no one actually
00:34:56.079 knows what's going to happen we're all
00:34:58.000 just doing the best we can so those are
00:35:01.240 my views on the market um again expect a
00:35:03.920 lot of volatility over the next few days
00:35:05.760 as more that labor market data comes in
00:35:07.680 if you go over here to the website we
00:35:09.359 have a macro dashboard you can see what
00:35:11.760 came in today right job openings job
00:35:13.400 quits highers layoffs and discharges and
00:35:16.680 High house price prices increase reduce
00:35:19.119 count whatever the hell that is um
00:35:21.800 Wednesday not a whole lot coming in we
00:35:23.800 do have non-farm private payroll I
00:35:25.599 believe that's the ADP uh coming in
00:35:27.880 tomorrow yeah the automatic data
00:35:29.400 processing research in so that's going
00:35:31.079 to be coming in tomorrow um so look for
00:35:33.560 that headline Thursday you don't really
00:35:35.960 have a whole lot other than initial
00:35:37.440 claims and continued claims Friday is
00:35:39.680 the big day right Friday is the big day
00:35:41.800 you got average hourly earnings you got
00:35:44.160 um the unemployment rate um the Su Ru
00:35:46.599 recession indicator which is just an you
00:35:48.200 know derivative Bas or an artifact of
00:35:49.640 the unemployment rate Help
00:35:51.839 Services um you know etc etc etc so
00:35:55.319 that's where we are that's what I think
00:35:56.680 is going on the market that's why I
00:35:58.040 think the market is currently weighing
00:35:59.520 and trying to figure out you know what's
00:36:02.359 actually going on if you see sort of
00:36:04.520 like a a labor market print that allows
00:36:07.640 the tenure to
00:36:09.680 drop it could be a good thing or a bad
00:36:11.880 thing depending on how bad it is right
00:36:13.480 if it's if it's just like a little
00:36:14.920 worrying and it's enough to kind of
00:36:16.800 stall out the rally of the 10-year yield
00:36:19.040 then risk assets can probably do okay
00:36:21.040 because again remember in
00:36:22.560 2023 and and even in 2022 when the
00:36:25.280 10year topped that's when risk ass
00:36:28.720 bottomed you could reach a point where
00:36:30.960 the 10e tops for the wrong reason but
00:36:34.720 hopefully whenever the tenure does top
00:36:36.599 it comes back down for a slightly
00:36:39.119 worrying thing but not overly worrying
00:36:41.480 it bounces again and then maybe then we
00:36:43.839 finally accept all right it's time to
00:36:45.319 deal with the consequences of all these
00:36:48.040 of all these rate hikes but again it's a
00:36:49.560 long process the business cycle takes
00:36:51.359 years to play out we're all just doing
00:36:53.000 the best we can thank you guys for
